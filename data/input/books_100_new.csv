60297;9783642586026;Maturation Phenomenon in Cerebral Ischemia III;The maturation phenomenon refers to postischemic changes that develop hours or days following an ischemic insult. The delayed neuronal death of CA1 pyramidical cells of the hippocampus is a classic example. The report of the phenomenon has boosted research in this field, as it became evident that ischemic damage is not a sudden event but a process potentially susceptible to therapeutic intervention. In September 1990, the first international symposium on  Maturation Phenomenon in Cerebral Ischemia  was held in Tokyo. The second symposium was organized in Tokyo in March/April 1996. Since then, new developments have rapidly delivered information about the molecular nature and dynamics of mechanisms concerning cell death and recovery. This book contains the presentations of the 3rd international symposium held in Pozilly/Italy in April 1998. It outlines the present status of the investigation and provides further stimulation for research in this field.

161157;9783642443183;Seismic Wave Propagation and Scattering in the Heterogeneous Earth : Second Edition;Seismic waves - generated both by natural earthquakes and by man-made sources - have produced an enormous amount of information about the Earth's interior. In classical seismology, the Earth is modeled as a sequence of uniform horizontal layers (or spherical shells) having different elastic properties and one determines these properties from travel times and dispersion of seismic waves. The Earth, however, is not made of horizontally uniform layers, and classic seismic methods can take large-scale inhomogeneities into account. Smaller-scale irregularities, on the other hand, require other methods. Observations of continuous wave trains that follow classic direct S waves, known as coda waves, have shown that there are heterogeneities of random size scattered randomly throughout the layers of the classic seismic model. This book focuses on recent developments in the area of seismic wave propagation and scattering through the randomly heterogeneous structure of the Earth, with emphasis on the lithosphere. The presentation combines information from many sources to present a coherent introduction to the theory of scattering in acoustic and elastic materials and includes analyses of observations using the theoretical methods developed. The second edition especially includes new observational facts such as the spatial variation of medium inhomogeneities and the temporal change in scattering characteristics and recent theoretical developments in the envelope synthesis in random media for the last ten years. Mathematics is thoroughly rewritten for improving the readability. Written for advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students of geophysics or planetary sciences, this book should also be of interest to civil engineers, seismologists, acoustical engineers, and others interested in wave propagation through inhomogeneous elastic media.

It is organized according to anatomo-surgical pathways to the hidden areas of the skull base. These pathways are described in step-by-step fashion with the aid of a wealth of color images and illustrations. The emphasis is on endoscopic anatomy, but in order to provide a holistic perspective, informative three-dimensional reconstructions are presented alongside the endoscopic images and radiologic images are included when appropriate. In effect, windows are opened on the anatomy so that the reader is guided on a journey throughout the skull base region. This anatomically oriented atlas will serve as an ideal learning tool for novice surgeons and will also prove an invaluable reference for the more experienced surgeon.
58475;9789813083608;Scientific Computing;This book concerns modern methods in scientific computing and linear algebra, relevant to image and signal processing. For these applications, it is important to consider ingredients such as: (1) sophisticated mathematical models of the problems, including a priori knowledge, (2) rigorous mathematical theories to understand the difficulties of solving problems which are ill-posed, and (3) fast algorithms for either real-time or data-massive computations. Such are the topics brought into focus by these proceedings of the Workshop on Scientific Computing (held in Hong Kong on March 10-12, 1997, the sixth in such series of Workshops held in Hong Kong since 1990), where the major themes were on numerical linear algebra, signal processing, and image processing.
20912;9783662024867;Integral/Structural Polymer Foams;Integral, or structural, foams are one of the most remarkable materials that have been developed over the last fifteen years. As with all rapidly growing fields, the terminology seems to have grown even faster. Thus there are two names for the material structure itself. In the United States and in Japan the term for these plastics is Structural Foams, whereas in Europe and the USSR the term used is usually Integral Foams. We have adhered to the European term in the text and hope our colleagues will bear with us. Integral foams have a specific structure: a cellular core that gradually turns into a solid skin. The skin gives the part its form and stiffness, while the cellular core contributes to the very high strength-to-weight values of the material. These are higher than those of some unfoamed plastics and metals. The sandwich-like structure with its unique mechanical properties was prompted by nature. Wood and bone are strong and light-weight natural materials having a cellular structure. Since the sandwich-like structure of the integral foams resembles that of natural wood, the foams are often referred to as artifical wood or plastic wood, thereby emphasizing not only the formal structural similarity of these materials, but also one of the main functional applications of integral foams - replacement of wooden articles in various fields of engineering and construction.
168773;9781461437093;Chemotherapy in Psychiatry;Extensively updated since its second edition in 1985, Chemotherapy in Psychiatry, Third Edition, again addresses basic aspects of modern psychopharmacology and clinical applications of drugs used in the treatment of major psychiatric disorders, with major emphasis on psychotic, bipolar, and depressive disorders. The presentation covers descriptions of the main classes of psychotropic drugs, selected information concerning their known action mechanisms and metabolic disposition, and their clinical applications for acute illnesses and to prevent recurrences and long-term morbidity. Also covered are limitations and adverse effects of each type of agent, with emphasis on the fact that all psychotropic medicines have adverse effects that range from annoying to potentially lethal. Chemotherapy in Psychiatry, Third Edition, outlines the need to balance benefits and risks at the level of individual persons. Authoritative, and an important contribution to the literature, Chemotherapy in Psychiatry, Third Edition is an invaluable resource for physicians, scientists, trainees, and policymakers.

The steps are illustrated with numerous examples drawn from real projects on which the author has worked. The book emphasizes traditional skills and shows how they can be combined effectively with modern technological approaches.
140269;9783540748540;Mechanochemistry in Nanoscience and Minerals Engineering;Mechanochemistry as a branch of solid state chemistry enquires into processes which proceed in solids due to the application of mechanical energy. This provides a thorough, up to date overview of mechanochemistry of solids and minerals. Applications of mechanochemistry in nanoscience with special impact on nanogeoscience are described. Selected advanced identification methods, most frequently applied in nanoscience, are described as well as the advantage of mechanochemical approach in minerals engineering. Examples of industrial applications are given. Mechanochemical technology is being applied in many industrial fields: powder metallurgy (synthesis of nanometals, alloys and nanocompounds), building industry (activation of cements), chemical industry (solid waste treatment, catalyst synthesis, coal ashes utilization), minerals engineering (ore enrichment, enhancement of processes of extractive metallurgy), agriculture industry (solubility increase of fertilizers), and pharmaceutical industry (improvement of solubility and bioavailability of drugs). This reference serves as an introduction to newcomers to mechanochemistry, and encourages more experienced researchers to broaden their knowledge and discover novel applications in the field.
140322;9783540744870;Services Science;The service sector has dominated advanced economies for years. In many countries, it accounts for more than 70% of gross domestic product, and approximately the same percentage of all employees work in this sector. To reflect the economic relevance of the service sector, services science must be established as an academic discipline. But the path in pursuit of this goal is riddled with challenges, especially in the fields of services research, service-oriented education and service-related collaborations. This book includes detailed articles and short statements on each field, written by academics and experts. They explain which challenges need to be met by research and academic training in the services community of the 21st century. The contributions contained in this book reflect the content of presentations and statements given at the first German Services Science Conference.

136845;9783642093302;Galactose Regulon of Yeast;The galactose regulon of yeast is one of the best studied regulons. It is an ideal paradigm for demonstrating fundamental and evolving concepts in biology and is used in this book as a model system to explain various facets of conventional and modern biology.  The book starts with a brief historical overview on yeast research, i.e. early observations in enzyme adaptation, classical genetics, formulating hypotheses based on genetic inference. This is followed by molecular genetics of the galactose regulon, isolation of genes and testing of the hypotheses. The power of mutational analysis in deciphering molecular mechanisms is conveyed. Further, contemporary topics such as genomics, evolution, single cell analysis of transcriptional switching, binary and graded responses, biological consequences of feed back regulation in genetic circuits, and stochasticity are addressed. 
136852;9783540721857;Geometric Modeling and Algebraic Geometry;The two fields of Geometric Modeling and Algebraic Geometry, though closely related, are traditionally represented by two almost disjoint scientific communities. Both fields deal with objects defined by algebraic equations, but the objects are studied in different ways. This contributed book presents, in 12 chapters written by leading experts, recent results which rely on the interaction of both fields. Some of these results have been obtained in the frame of the European GAIA II project (IST 2001-35512) entitled  Intersection algorithms for geometry-based IT applications using approximate algebraic methods .
149660;9783540853688;Numerical Methods in Multidimensional Radiative Transfer;The book provides an overview of the numerical modelling of radiation fields in multidimensional geometries. It covers advances and problems in the mathematical treatment of the radiative transfer equation, a partial integro-differential equation of high dimension that describes the propagation of the radiation in various fields. Highly accurate and fast methods with sound analytical foundations are particularly emphasized. The volume should not only serve as a basis for the selection of suitable methods for actual radiative transfer problems in disciplines from astronomy and climatology to radiological diagnostics but also be a starting point for additional mathematical investigations on many still unknown aspects of the transfer equation.
156850;9783642181733;Induction Chemotherapy;Induction chemotherapy, as part of an integrated plan of management for locally advanced cancers, is being practised throughout the world in independent, isolated departments in universities, teaching hospitals, and clinical schools. Frequently, however, teams are relatively unaware of the work being undertaken in other institutions, and this situation may slow further progress. This book aims to present the full range of management techniques and practices used in induction chemotherapy within one accessible volume. It provides up-to-date information on the pioneering and cutting edge practices employed in different institutions and documents the advantages of integrated treatment schedules. Patient selection is discussed, and each of the cancer types for which induction therapy has proved important is considered in detail. All who are responsible for the treatment of patients with locally advanced cancers will find this book to be an invaluable source of information. It will be particularly interesting for specialist oncologists aiming to set up and develop fully comprehensive cancer centres and for health administrators wishing to learn about the benefits of establishing such centres in strategic locations.
156141;9783642139802;Integrated Systems of Meso-Meteorological and Chemical Transport Models;This book, as the outcome of the COST-728/NetFAM workshop, focuses on the follow­ing main topics: 1) on-line coupled meteorology-chemistry modelling with two-way feedbacks, 2) off-line coupled modelling and interfaces, 3) validation and case studies including air quality related episodes, and 4) integration of atmospheric chemical transport (ACT) models with numerical weather prediction (NWP).This book is one of the first attempts to give an overall look on such integrated meso-meteorology and chemistry modelling approach. It reviews the current situation with the on-line and off-line coupling of mesoscale meteorological and ACT models worldwide as well as discusses advantages and shortcomings, best practices, and gives recommendations for on-line and off-line coupling of NWP and ACT models, implementation strategy for different feedback mechanisms, direct and indirect effects of aerosols and advanced interfaces between both types of models. The book is oriented towards numerical weather prediction and air quality modelling communities.
168300;9783642192333;Dimensional Analysis;Dimensional analysis is an essential scientific method and a powerful tool for solving problems in physics and engineering.

It also provides ample and detailed examples of how dimensional analysis is applied to solving problems in various branches of mechanics. The book covers the extensive findings on explosion mechanics and impact dynamics contributed by the author’s research group over the past forty years at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The book is intended for advanced undergraduates and graduate students of physics and engineering, as well as research scientists and engineers working in related fields.Qingming Tan is a former researcher at the Institute of Mechanics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.
168608;9783642190346;Justice and Conflicts;Central to the book are questions concerning the existence and the characteristics of justice motives, and concerning the influence that justice motives and justice judgements have on the emergence, but also the solution of social conflicts. Five main themes will be addressed: (1) “Introduction and justice motive”, (2) “organizational justice”, (3) “ecological justice”, (4) “social conflicts”, and (5) “solution of conflicts”.The authors of the editions are scholars of psychology, as well as distinguished experts from various other disciplines, including sociologists, economists, legal scholar, educationalists, and ethicists. The common ground of all contributors is their independent conduction of empirical research on justice issues. Apart from the German contributors, authors represent scholars from the US, India, Korea, New Zealand, and various European countries (Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, UK, Sweden).
59098;9781493950232;Peripheral Endovascular Interventions;This book is a comprehensive review of the rapidly advancing field of endovascular therapy, written by internationally recognized authorities in the field, many of whom are the innovators of the techniques and devices involved. Broad in scope, topics covered range from how to obtain training in approved endovascular techniques to promising new lines of investigational therapies. Reflecting the operative nature of many of the new endovascular therapies, this book is somewhat unique for an endovascular text in the strong representation of surgeons among its authors. Purpose: The purpose is to train and update physicians with diverse levels of experience and from a variety of specialties in established, new, and still evolving endovascular techniques. Given the wide variation in expertise among different specialties interested in performing these procedures, and acknowledging that different specialties lack skill in different aspects of various procedures, a book such as this is badly needed. The goals are accomplished by providing broad overviews of the basics for those with little experience and in-depth presentations of advanced topics for more skilled physicians. Audience: The audience includes vascular surgeons, who will take particular interest in the coverage of endovascular equipment and basic percutaneous techniques, and interventional cardiologists and radiologists, who have had little previous exposure to the operative aspects of endovascular therapy discussed in detail in this book. From the preface to the second edition: Catheter-based diagnosis and treatment of vascular diseases has evolved over the last several decades, with a recent increase occurring in the utility of the therapeutic methods. This development has been stimulated by several factors including miniaturization of interventional devices and imaging technologies, and an emphasis on the utilization of minimally invasive, cost-effective treatments that reduce the economic impact of health care delivery. As part of this evolution, the development and adaptation of new interventional techniques and devices has produced a continual need for updating and training physicians in several subspecialties regarding the use of these methodologies. This requires not only adapting the technologies to current clinical practice but also establishing educational training curriculum in subspecialty fellowship programs. Because endovascular technologies are of multispecialty interest, a review of the entire scope of fundamental information regarding each aspect of the field is required to furnish a comprehensive review that will provide specific utility for individuals from different disciplines. For this reason, we have undertaken the development of this text to satisfy two goals. The first is to provide a broad overview of the entire range of topics for clinicians with little or no background relevant to the subject matter. Secondly, those with some familiarity will find definitive informational material to allow adaptation of endovascular technologies to their current clinical practice. To adequately understand and safely use catheter-based interventional therapies, knowledge of a number of topics beyond the clinical indications and techniques for applying endovascular methods is required. A thorough understand of the pathophysiology of vascular disease, safety issues regarding interventional devices and imaging methods, and a comprehension of fundamental biomaterials concepts is needed. These topics are addressed in detail and represent relatively mature aspects of this field that are otherwise characterized by continual change in devices and techniques as the field expands.
160471;9781461410829;Research on e-Learning and ICT in Education;An essential text for researchers and academics seeking the most comprehensive and up-to-date coverage of all aspects of ICT in education and e-learning, this book is a multidisciplinary forum covering technical, pedagogical, organizational, instructional, and policy aspects of the topic.  Special emphasis is given to applied research relevant to educational practice and guided by the educational realities in schools, colleges, universities and informal learning organizations. The volume encompasses the current trends and issues which determine and inform the integration of ICT into educational practice, including teaching and learning, curriculum and instructional design, appropriate learning media and environments, teacher education and professional development, and appropriate assessment and evaluation.
49936;9781461223948;Programming in SCHEME;Scheme provides a flexible and powerful language for programming embodying many of the best features of logical and functional programming. This enjoyable book provides readers with an introduction to programming in Scheme by constructing a series of interesting and re-usable programs. The book includes two diskettes containing MIT Scheme to run on Windows PCs.
50565;9781461239963;Aerospace Sensor Systems and Applications;This book is about aerospace sensors, their principles of operation, and their typical advantages, shortcomings, and vulnerabilities. They are described in the framework of the subsystems where they function and in accordance with the flight mission they are designed to serve. The book is intended for students at the advanced undergraduate or graduate level and for research engineers who need to acquire this kind of knowledge. An effort has been made to explain, within a uniform framework of mathematical modeling, the physics upon which a certain sensor concept is based, its construction, its dynamics, and its error sources and their corresponding mathematical models. Equipped with such knowledge and understanding, the student or research engineer should be able to get involved in research and development activities of guidance, control, and navigation systems and to contribute to the initiation of novel ideas in the aerospace sensor field. As a designer and systems engineer, he should be able to correctly interpret the various items in a technical data list and thus to interact intelligently with manufacturers' representatives and other members of an R&D team. Much of the text has evolved from undergraduate and graduate courses given by the author during the past seventeen years at the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Technion- Israel Institute of Technology and from his earlier research and development experience in flight control, guidance, navigation, and avionics at the Ministry of Defense Central Research Institute.

49450;9783540676652;Basement Regions;The basement regions constitute more than two-thirds of outcropping bedrock material across our planet's continents. During the past 30 years French geomorphologists have contributed greatly to the characterization of some of the laws and patterns of landform evolution in shields and crystaliine areas with changing bioclimatic environments. This volume reflects the search for a better understanding of landscapes and landforms in igneous and metamorphic terrains at different latitudes. Furthermore, it covers a wide field of investigation gathered on four continents and addresses the issue at a wide range of spatial and timescales. It is an ideal volume not only for post-graduate geomorphology students but also for geoscience scholars concerned with igneous petrology, quaternary geology, physical geography, soil science and land use planning.
46773;9780387945187;Computational Economics and Finance;As with the first volume, Volume Two of Economic and Financial Modeling with Mathematica  is edited by Hal Varian, and its contributors are carefully selected by him to assure a high quality, practical work reflecting the efforts and expertise of an international cadre of Mathematica users from the economic, financial, investments, quantitative business and operations research communities.
48344;9783540671985;Dynamics of Rockslides and Rockfalls;Mass movement of rocks in high mountains can severely injure the population and damage man-made structures in these areas. This book focuses on the understanding of the mechanisms of rockslides and rockfalls using a quantitative approach. The range and velocity of these hazards are calculated to serve as a basis for evacuations and other preventive measures. Examples from four continents illustrate the necessity of this kind of information. The book contains a wealth of information for practitioners and scientists working in the field of catastrophe prevention.
38307;9783709166772;The Search for Christian Doppler;It is now 150 years ago, on 25th May 1842, that the son of a Salzburg ston­ emason presented a scientific work  On the coloured light of the double stars and certain other heavenly bodies  at a meeting of the Royal Bo­ hemian Society of Sciences held in Prague. Christian Andreas Doppler, then professor at the Prague Technical Institute, set a milestone in scien­ tific history in the meeting room of the Royal Society in the Charles Uni­ versity, just a few meters from the National Theatre where another genius from Salzburg, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, had celebrated his musical triumph with the premiere of his opera Don Giovanni fifty-five years earlier. Doppler's lecture set out in brilliant simplicity what we now call the Doppler principle, which since has found numerous uses in astronomy, which was of primary interest to Christian Doppler. In addition, it has found countless practical applications in physics, navigation, aeronautics, geodesy, medicine, science and technology. In medicine alone, Doppler sonography is now an established diagnostic procedure in the fields of childbirth, cardiology and diseases of the blood vessels, neurology, neuro­ surgery and vascular surgery, and is continually finding new medical appli­ cations in today's world of high technology.
49359;9781461273738;Computer Intensive Methods in Control and Signal Processing;Due to the rapid increase in readily available computing power, a corre­ sponding increase in the complexity of problems being tackled has occurred in the field of systems as a whole. A plethora of new methods which can be used on the problems has also arisen with a constant desire to deal with more and more difficult applications. Unfortunately by increasing the ac­ curacy in models employed along with the use of appropriate algorithms with related features, the resultant necessary computations can often be of very high dimension. This brings with it a whole new breed of problem which has come to be known as  The Curse of Dimensionality  . The expression  Curse of Dimensionality  can be in fact traced back to Richard Bellman in the 1960's. However, it is only in the last few years that it has taken on a widespread practical significance although the term di­ mensionality does not have a unique precise meaning and is being used in a slightly different way in the context of algorithmic and stochastic complex­ ity theory or in every day engineering. In principle the dimensionality of a problem depends on three factors: on the engineering system (subject), on the concrete task to be solved and on the available resources. A system is of high dimension if it contains a lot of elements/variables and/or the rela­ tionship/connection between the elements/variables is complicated.
51392;9781461217206;The Four-Color Theorem;During the university reform of the 1970s, the classical Faculty of Science of the venerable Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat in Munich was divided into five smaller faculties. One was for mathematics, the others for physics, chemistry and pharmaceutics, biology, and the earth sciences. Nevertheless, in order to maintain an exchange of ideas between the various disciplines and so as not to permit the complete undermining of the original notion of  universitas,,,l the Carl-Friedrich-von-Siemens Foundation periodically invites the pro­ fessors from the former Faculty of Science to a luncheon gathering. These are working luncheons during which recent developments in the various disciplines are presented by means of short talks. The motivation for such talks does not come, in the majority of cases, from the respective subject itself, but from another discipline that is loosely affiliated with it. In this way, the controversy over the modern methods used in the proof of the Four-Color Theorem had also spread to disciplines outside of mathematics. I, as a trained algebraic topologist, was asked to comment on this. Naturally, I was acquainted with the Four-Color 1 A Latin word meaning the whole of something, a collective entirety. Vll viii Preface Problem but, up to that point, had never intensively studied it. As an outsider,2 I dove into the material, not so much to achieve any scientific progress with it but to make this already achieved objective more understandable.
51171;9780387949352;Tibaldo and the Hole in the Calendar;Tibaldo and the Hole in the Calendar is the story of how an eleven-year old boy growing up in 16th century Italy loses his birthday when the Gregorian calendar replaces the Julian calendar in 1582, and how he fights to prevent this loss. The author cleverly weaves elements of the cultural and scientific milieu of his time into an engaging and intelligent tale. Tibaldo's father is a medical assistant, and his sister is a midwife. He grows up learning about current medical practices by watching his father and sister and by listening to the great Professor Turisanus, for whom his father works. Tibaldo is fascinated by medicine and proves himself to be a fast learner, quickly gaining the respect of Professor Turasanus, who becomes a mentor for Tibaldo and sends him to the very best of schools. However, when Tibaldo learns that the Julian calendar is about to be revised, he realizes that he is about to lose his 13th birthday and determines to do something about this. The result is amusing and informative.
118266;9783540346760;Offshore Wind Energy;The accompanying ecological research for using wind energy in the German North and Baltic Seas has brought out a variety of results concerning possible effects on the marine environment. This book provides an overview of the state of the accompanying ecological research in Germany. It shows the relevance of the new results of the research projects for the planning and permission process for offshore wind energy farms.
160584;9783642122255;ICT for the Next Five Billion People;Currently, around one to two billion users are able to connect to the Internet, most of them living in the industrialized parts of the world. However, if we want to improve the quality of life of the world population with the help of access to information and education, it is necessary that in the next decade an additional five billion people gain access to the Internet. The next five billion Internet users are mainly living in emerging economies. Therefore, the main challenge is to lower the economic barrier using new approaches for infrastructure deployment and service delivery to billions of people. This book reflects the discussions of the challenges from the Münchner Kreis with representatives from the ICT industry, academia, non-governmental organizations and governmental development organizations, among them many representatives from emerging economies in Africa and Asia. They had highlighted the real demand for ICT, and what impact ICT creates for the wealth and lifestyle of the people.
135936;9783540713470;Cognitive Economics;As a manifestation of a 'cognitive turn' observable in all social sciences, Cognitive Economics is concerned with the beliefs and mental operations held by actors placed within a dynamical and strategic environment. It appears as a synthesis of an educative research program, dealing with crossed expectations of actors, and an evolutionist research program on collective learning processes. The book mainly aims at extending the framework of game theory in order to better fit the results of rapidly increasing laboratory experiments concerned with individual choices and collective interactions. It also seeks to better explain some original economic phenomena involving boundedly rational agents in an institutional setting such as financial bubbles, job search or technological innovation. Written in an informal way, the book is addressed to philosophers or cognitive scientists curious of how economics deal with cognition, as well as graduate students in economics eager to discover how economic science evolves.
161378;9783642168093;Advanced Digital Preservation;There is growing recognition of the need to address the fragility of digital information, on which our society heavily depends for smooth operation in all aspects of daily life. This has been discussed in many books and articles on digital preservation, so why is there a need for yet one more? Because, for the most part, those other publications focus on documents, images and webpages – objects that are normally rendered to be simply displayed by software to a human viewer. Yet there are clearly many more types of digital objects that may need to be preserved, such as databases, scientific data and software itself.David Giaretta, Director of the Alliance for Permanent Access,  and his contributors explain why the tools and techniques used for preserving rendered objects are inadequate for all these other types of digital objects, and they provide the concepts, techniques and tools that are needed. The book is structured in three parts. The first part is on theory, i.e., the concepts and techniques that are essential for preserving digitally encoded information. The second part then shows practice, i.e., the use and validation of these tools and techniques. Finally, the third part concludes by addressing how to judge whether money is being well spent, in terms of effectiveness and cost sharing.Various examples of digital objects from many sources are used to explain the tools and techniques presented. The presentation style mainly aims at practitioners in libraries, archives and industry who are either directly responsible for preservation or who need to prepare for audits of their archives. Researchers in digital preservation and developers of preservation tools and techniques will also find valuable practical information here. Researchers creating digitally encoded information of all kinds will also need to be aware of these topics so that they can help to ensure that their data is usable and can be valued by others now and in the future.To further assist the reader, the book is supported by many hours of videos and presentations from the CASPAR project and by a set of open source software.

91069;9783642115455;Quantitative Sociodynamics;This new edition of Quantitative Sociodynamics presents a general strategy for interdisciplinary model building and its application to a quantitative description of behavioral changes based on social interaction processes. Originally, the crucial methods for the modeling of complex systems (stochastic methods and nonlinear dynamics) were developed in physics and mathematics, but they have very often proven their explanatory power in chemistry, biology, economics and the social sciences as well. Quantitative Sociodynamics provides a unified and comprehensive overview of the different stochastic methods, their interrelations and properties. In addition, it introduces important concepts from nonlinear dynamics (e.g. synergetics, chaos theory). The applicability of these fascinating concepts to social phenomena is carefully discussed. By incorporating decision-theoretical approaches, a fundamental dynamic model is obtained, which opens new perspectives in the social sciences. It includes many established models as special cases, e.g. the logistic equation, the gravity model, some diffusion models, evolutionary game theory and social field theory. Moreover, it implies numerous new results and is relevant for various application areas, such as opinion formation, migration, the self-organization of behavioral conventions, and the behavior of customers and voters. Theoretical results are complemented and illustrated by numerous computer simulations.Quantitative Sociodynamics is relevant both for social scientists and natural scientists who are interested in the application of stochastic and synergetics concepts to interdisciplinary topics. 
137470;9781489996503;Principles of Ecosystem Stewardship;Natural resource management is entering a new era in which rapid environmental and social changes inevitably alter ecosystems and the benefits they provide to society. This textbook provides a new framework for natural resource management—a framework based on stewardship of ecosystems for ecological integrity and human well-being in a world dominated by uncertainty and change. The goal of ecosystem stewardship is to respond to and shape changes in social-ecological systems in order to sustain the supply and availability of ecosystem services by society. The book links recent advances in the theory of resilience, sustainability, and vulnerability with practical issues of ecosystem management and governance. Chapters by leading experts then illustrate these principles in major social-ecological systems of the world.

137829;9780387729725;Biological Low-Voltage Scanning Electron Microscopy;Field-emission, low-voltage scanning electron microscopy (LVSEM) is a field that has grown tremendously in recent years because is offers the optimal method for viewing complex surfaces at high resolution and in three dimensions. However, even though the instrumentation required to get good results at low beam voltage has become increasingly available, there has been a lag in its application to biological specimens. What seemed to be missing was volume that combined both the theory and practice of using this equipment in an optimal manner with a thorough treatment of biological specimen preparation.  Biological Low-Voltage Scanning Electron Microscopy is the first book to address both of these aspects of biological LVSEM. After providing a thorough description of the unique advantages and the operating constraints related to operating a scanning electron microscope at low beam voltage, the remainder of book focuses on the the best way to image all types of plant and animal cells and covers specimens that range from macromolecules to the surfaces revealed by de-embedding resin-embedded samples. Advanced specimen preparation techniques such as cryo-LVSEM, and immuno-gold-LVSEM are fully covered, as is x-ray microanalysis at low beam voltage and live-time stereo imaging. The preparative protocols provided represent the distilled essence of the experience of a group of world-renowned authors who have, for many decades, been instrumental in developing and applying new approaches to LVSEM to support their own biological research.

132800;9780387786506;The Uncertainty in Physical Measurements;All measurements of physical quantities are affected by uncertainty.  Understanding the origin of uncertainty, evaluating its extent and suitably taking it into account in data analysis is essential for assessing the degree of accuracy of phenomenological relationships and physical laws in both scientific research and technological applications. The Uncertainty in Physical Measurements: An Introduction to Data Analysis in the Physics Laboratory presents an introduction to uncertainty and to some of the most common procedures of data analysis.  This book will serve the reader well by filling the gap between tutorial textbooks and highly specialized monographs.  The book is divided into three parts. The first part is a phenomenological introduction to measurement and uncertainty: properties of instruments, different causes and corresponding expressions of uncertainty, histograms and distributions, and unified expression of uncertainty. The second part contains an introduction to probability theory, random variable distributions and basic statistical tools. The third part introduces the readers to some basic data analysis procedures: propagation of uncertainty, least squares fit, chi square test, and confidence intervals to name a few. The introduction of probability and statistical tools is made on phenomenological grounds, as a natural response to the problems arising in the laboratory practice.  The author has made a concentrated effort to guarantee both accuracy and clarity through the introduction of a large number of figures and worked examples, many of them taken from laboratory experimentations and practice.  The book is enriched by the detailed proposal of several simple experiments. Paolo Fornasini is a Professor of Physics at the University of Trento, Italy.  He is the author, with Giuseppe Dalba, of Esercizi di Fisica: Meccanica e Termodinamica (Springer 2006).
144196;9781441959201;Health Assets in a Global Context;"Health Assets in a Global Context: Theory, Methods, Action Edited by Antony Morgan, Maggie Davies, and Erio Ziglio As global health inequities continue to widen, policymakers are redoubling their efforts to address them. Yet the effectiveness and quality of these programs vary considerably, sometimes resulting in the reverse of expected outcomes. While local political issues or cultural conflicts may play a part in these situations, an important new book points to a universal factor: the prevailing deficit model of assessing health needs, which puts disadvantaged communities on the defensive while ignoring their potential strengths. The asset model proposed in Health Assets in a Global Context offers a necessary complement to the problem-focused framework by assessing multiple levels of health-promoting aspects in populations, and promoting joint solutions between communities and outside agencies. The book provides not only rationales and methodologies (e.g., measuring resilience and similar elusive qualities) but also concrete examples of asset-based initiatives in use across the world on the individual and community levels, including: •;Strengthening the assets of disadvantaged women (Germany). •;Sustainable community-based development programs (India). •;Using parental assets to control child malaria (West Africa). •;Asset/evidence-based health promotion in the schools (Romania). •;Evaluating asset-based programs (Latin America). •;Using social capital to promote health equity (Australia). Health Assets in a Global Context offers a new, positive lens for viewing the world’s most resistant public health crises, making it fundamental reading for researchers and graduate students in public health, especially those involved in health promotion, health disparities, social determinants of health, and global health."
144350;9781489983756;Securing Wireless Communications at the Physical Layer;Wireless systems are becoming increasingly pervasive and securing these systems has been challenging, in large part due to the unique properties associated with wireless communications. Securing these networks has traditionally been approached by taking a conventional approach involving cryptographic protocols. Such an approach inherently seeks to secure the wireless network at the link layer and above, and consequently fails to leverage the most unique characteristic of wireless communication: its physical layer. Securing Wireless Communications at the Physical Layer is a compilation of contributions by experts in wireless communications and security, and presents state-of-the-art results that examine the challenge of introducing security at the physical layer of a wireless system. Throughout this book there is an underlying theme that the rich multipath environment that is typical of wireless scenarios supports the establishment of new security services at the physical layer, including new mechanisms that establish cryptographic keys, that support communication with assured confidentiality, and that can authenticate transmitters in mobile environments. The book takes a holistic approach to covering topics related to physical layer security solutions, with contributions ranging from the theoretical underpinnings behind secure communications to practical systems validations that have been performed on real wireless systems. The book also covers topics related to ensuring that cooperative wireless communications at the physical layer is trustworthy. Additionally, the emerging area of modulation forensics, whereby a device is able to identify the modulation format being employed by other devices is explored. Securing Wireless Communications at the Physical Layer will serve as a valuable reference to engineers and researchers in the fields of security and wireless communications.

The information provided in Central Nervous System Diseases and Inflammation will be useful for researchers, clinicians, as well as a valuable resource for students interested in the fascinating arena of neuroinflammation.
144494;9781441945457;The Conflict Over Environmental Regulation in the United States;The crisis of the Santa Barbara offshore oil spill in 1969 led to the passage of radically new environmental laws that made the United States an international leader in environmental protection at the time. Since then, environmental regulation has proved detrimental to both industrial and environmental performance. It contributed to a deepening confrontation between environmental and industrial groups, a rift which spread to other areas of politics and society. This book traces the origin of the current conflict and carefully analyzes current environmental and resource policy. Other advanced nations, especially in the EU, evolved more sophisticated and cooperative policies. These have led to high environmental quality and have permitted the EU to lead in global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the environmental regulatory policies have fostered robust industrial and fiscal performance. Americans know something has gone wrong in the U.S. The book's candid comparison of U.S. and EU policies yields fresh perspectives on sources of U.S. dilemmas in energy policy, Congressional lawmaking, and other areas of concern.  Managing the environment has become an issue of such bitter partisanship in the U.S. that the prospects for further progress may seem bleak. Frank Manheim's detailed, even-handed, and historically grounded analysis offers a generous counterpoint to today's rancorous environmental politics. His book challenges Americans to look beyond domestic gridlock, and regain perspective by taking advantage of EU experience and building a sense of mission around the interlocking goals of climate stabilization, energy independence, and economic vitality.  -Daniel Sarewitz, Director of the Consortium for Science, Policy, and Outcomes, Arizona State University  Frank T. Manheim is an affiliate professor in the School of Public Policy, George Mason University. In course of more than 30 years as a federal government ocean and earth scientist he served on numerous interagency and scientific advisory panels including the National Academy of Science--National Research Council, National Science Foundation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Bureau of Land Management and Minerals Management Service, and industry associations.

165306;9781441967442;Evolution of Radiation Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital;The Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) has a history of excellence and is internationally recognized as a world class medical center, providing quality medical care, advancing medicine through clinical and laboratory research and facilitating the education of exceptional health care professionals. The Massachusetts General Hospital Radiation Oncology Department, staff, residents and fellows, past and present, concur that MGH stands for Man’s Greatest Hospital. This decidedly immodest assessment is widely viewed amongst the group as being manifestly true, and that perception is clearly reflected in a marvelous esprit de corp. Such an unequivocally positive attitude is solidly based on the judgment that the best possible care is provided to each MGH patient, i.e. the patient is, in fact, Number One. There is a deep sense of pride in the contributions made by this department to the scientific advancement of oncology, with an objective to continue progressively and substantially increasing the proportion of patients who are free of tumor and of treatment related morbidity. Evolution of Radiation of Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital is the work of the former Chair of the Department, Herman D. Suit, with his successor, Jay S. Loeffler. From 1970 – 2000, Dr. Suit’s guidance and management of this Department brought it to recognition as a world class center. Dr. Suit was key in developing and building the Department that now includes The Northeast Proton Therapy Center at the MGH. His passion for the science of radiation therapy and its evolution through the years is evident in this book. Dr. Loeffler is a pioneer in the development and application of novel radiation delivery technologies and the use of biologics to enhance radiation effect for patients with brain tumors. Dr. Suit and Dr. Loeffler continue their close collaboration at MGH. This fascinating chronicle begins with the creation of MGH in 1811, followed by personal experiences of the Radiation Oncology Department.
126980;9780387768939;Collaborative Medicine Case Studies;Collaborative Medicine Case Studies Evidence in Practice  Edited by Rodger Kessler and Dale Stafford, Berlin Family Health, Montpelier, Vermont and Department of Family Medicine University of Vermont College of Medicine    Just as the mind and body collaborate in maintaining one’s health, collaboration between primary and behavioral health care can bring patients more efficacious treatment and better long-term results, from better compliance with or less dependence on medication to more effective use of health care services.   Collaborative Medicine Case Studies shows physicians and mental health practitioners working together across a variety of settings to assess and treat entrenched illnesses, combined physical and psychological conditions (back pain/panic attacks, diabetes/bipolar disorder), and cases that defy straightforward diagnosis. At the same time, the cases reflect the economic and financial realities of contemporary health care.   The cases discussed generate creative solutions using different levels of collaboration depending on patient need and site variables, but all share important similarities: close communication, careful follow-up by physician and behavioral health collaborators, and patients who would not have been treated as effectively without collaborative care. Blending research evidence, clinical insight, welcome humor, and realistic optimism, these cases demonstrate impressive successes, instructive setbacks, and comparative viewpoints while shedding light on the logistical, financial, and training challenges of integrative practice.  A sampling of the three dozen cases:   The head and the brain: migraines, orofacial pain, tinnitus.   Comorbid PTSD and persistent pain.   Individuals and couples with complex medical/emotional problems.   Chronic illnesses: obesity, spina bifida, cardiovascular disease.   A Hmong woman’s post-immigration depression.    A physician with anorexia   Burn patients who keep coming back without treatment success.   Collaborative Medicine Case Studies is a blueprint for a vanguard in care, not only for physicians and psychologists but also for professionals and graduate students in health psychology and health care administration and finance.
119670;9780387721712;Cultural Competence in Health Care;Cultural Competence in Health Care A Guide for Professionals  Wen-Shing Tseng, University of Hawaii, Honolulu Jon Streltzer, University of Hawaii, Honolulu  Between a growing pan-ethnic patient base, the need to solve inequalities of care, and the clinical desirability of viewing clients in their entirety, applied cultural knowledge is emerging as a major goal of clinical and public health practice. Cultural Competence in Health Care offers a wealth of this crucial knowledge with emphasis on day-to-day clinical work. Authors Tseng and Streltzer, well-known experts on transcultural medicine and therapy, start by differentiating between disease and illness and advise on a range of practical matters, from discussing culturally sensitive subjects to negotiating compromises between traditional healing and established medicine, so that readers will gain both useful working techniques and valuable empathy with clients. Case studies highlight medical issues as they apply to various minority (and majority) groups, and eight insightful chapters reveal cultural dimensions expressed in:     Concepts of illness and illness behaviors.   Assessment, interviews, and symptom presentation.   Hospitalization, medication, family involvement, consent issues.   Highly charged medical areas, e.g., pain management, transfusions, reproductive issues, organ donation.   Frequently stigmatized conditions such as AIDS, STDs, cancer, and psychiatric disorders.   Care by non-medical professionals, including social workers, physical therapists, and nutritionists.   Cultural Competence in Health Care is equally suited to use by practitioners and students in medicine, psychology, nursing, social work, and affiliated fields. And since it’s one of the only practice-oriented books on the topic, cross-cultural courses in training programs will find it especially useful.
119675;9781441940940;Linear Optimization Problems with Inexact Data;Linear programming attracted the interest of mathematicians during and after World War II when the first computers were constructed and methods for solving large linear programming problems were sought in connection with specific practical problems—for example, providing logistical support for the U.S. Armed Forces or modeling national economies. Early attempts to apply linear programming methods to solve practical problems failed to satisfy expectations. There were various reasons for the failure. One of them, which is the central topic of this book, was the inexactness of the data used to create the models. This phenomenon, inherent in most pratical problems, has been dealt with in several ways. At first, linear programming models used  average” values of inherently vague coefficients, but the optimal solutions of these models were not always optimal for the original problem itself. Later researchers developed the stochastic linear programming approach, but this too has its limitations. Recently, interest has been given to linear programming problems with data given as intervals, convex sets and/or fuzzy sets. The individual results of these studies have been promising, but the literature has not presented a unified theory. Linear Optimization Problems with Inexact Data attempts to present a comprehensive treatment of linear optimization with inexact data, summarizing existing results and presenting new ones within a unifying framework. Audience This book is intended for postgraduate or graduate students in the areas of operations research, optimization theory, linear algebra, interval analysis, reliable computing, and fuzzy sets. The book will also be useful for researchers in these respective areas.
107214;9781441952592;Americanization of the European Economy;One of the main features of the world economy since the late nineteenth century has been the growing dominance of the American economy in both quantitative and qualitative terms. Aspects of this development - e.g. rationalization or the world-wide diffusion of Coca-Cola - have been researched, but largely in isolation. Americanization of the European Economy provides a comprehensive yet compact survey of the growth of American economic influence in Europe since the 1880s. Three distinct but cumulative waves of Americanization are identified. Americanization was (and still is) a complex process of technological, political, and cultural transfer, and this overview explains why and how the USA and the American model of industrial capitalism came to be accepted as the dominant paradigm of political economy in today's Europe. Americanization of the European Economy summarizes the ongoing discussion by business historians, sociologists, and political scientists and makes it accessible to all types of readers who are interested in political and economic development.

In addition, this volume highlights developments in genetic engineering that are paving the way for potential therapeutic treatments of these viruses.
107579;9781441935847;Quality of Telephone-Based Spoken Dialogue Systems;Quality of Telephone-Based Spoken Dialogue Systems is a systematic overview of assessment, evaluation, and prediction methods for the quality of services such as travel and touristic information, phone-directory and messaging, or telephone-banking services. A new taxonomy of quality-of-service is presented which serves as a tool for classifying assessment and evaluation methods, for planning and interpreting evaluation experiments, and for estimating quality. A broad overview of parameters and evaluation methods is given, both on a system-component level and for a fully integrated system. Three experimental investigations illustrate the relationships between system characteristics and perceived quality. The resulting information is needed in all phases of system specification, design, implementation, and operation.  Although Quality of Telephone-Based Spoken Dialogue Systems is written from the perspective of an engineer in telecommunications, it is an invaluable source of information for professionals in signal processing, communication acoustics, computational linguistics, speech and language sciences, human factor design and ergonomics.
107593;9780387321813;Chassin's Operative Strategy in Esophageal Surgery;Chassin’s Operative Strategies in Esophageal Surgery offers the reader a succinct review of surgical techniques for disorders of the esophagus.

107606;9780387253985;Proteomics of Spermatogenesis;Recent developments of experimental techniques in cellular and molecular biology have made it possible to understand the molecular biology of male gametogenesis in greater detail. This book focuses on the description of specialized proteins, which are dominantly and/or specifically expressed in germ cells and localized in spermatozoa. There is an urgent need to classify proteins of spermatogenic cells with a view of their functions, and their applications in the regulation of fertility and in understanding infertility. The understanding of structural properties of male germ cell specific proteins can offer vulnerable points for targeted intervention in testis without generalized effects on stages of spermatogenesis. Besides targeted action in male germ cells, sperm specific proteins and polypeptides may also offer potential application in the development of a contraceptive vaccine.  Researchers in the fields of biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, reproductive biology and proteomics will find this book of interest.         This book is far superior to any previous book on the subject. I recommend this book with great enthusiasm.   Pawan K. Singal St. Boniface General Hospital Research Center    
107411;9781489987235;Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disorders;A child presents with weight loss, fatigue, and stomach pain. Is the diagnosis psychological, as in an eating disorder? Might it be medical, as in a GI disorder? Could it be both? A young adolescent is assessed to have a gastrointestinal disorder. Do you take puberty into account when planning treatment? Complex overlapping of physical and psychological symptoms is a hallmark of cases such as these—and a major factor in making diagnosis and intervention difficult. In Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disorders:Biopsychosocial Assessment and Treatment, authors Cunningham and Banez pool their considerable expertise to give practitioners working with children a state-of-the-art, biopsychosocial grounding in this challenging area of practice: -In-depth overview of pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, their prevalence and etiology   -Descriptions of the most common disorders (including irritable bowel syndrome, recurring abdominal pain, rumination disorder, and fecal incontinence), with their typical psychological and behavioral symptoms  -Conceptual and theoretical perspectives informing the authors’ biopsychosocial approach  -Reviews of empirically-based, clinically sound assessment and treatment strategies  -Case studies applying this knowledge in real-world detail, demonstrating collaborations between clinicians, patients, and families. Its lucid presentation, level of detail, and commitment to integrative care make Assessment and Treatment of Gastrointestinal Disorders in Children an important resource for children’s practitioners in both the medical and mental health fields. By featuring examples ranging from toddlers to teens, the authors have modeled a continuum of developmentally appropriate treatment.
137057;9781617378829;Evidence-Based Medical Ethics:;In the modern practice of medicine, new challenges complicate the ethical care of patients. Today’s times require a contemporary take on the concept of medical ethics. The idea for this textbook was born out of a need for a teaching resource that merges medical ethics theory with the practical needs of modern clinical medicine. In Evidence-Based Medical Ethics: Cases for Practice-Based Learning, the authors address what has been missing in existing text books and ethics courses to date – clear-cut ethical and legal guidelines that provide a method for the reader to learn how to systematically manage dilemmas seen in the everyday practice of medicine. The reader is guided through several  typical  patient scenarios and prompted by various questions that should be entertained by the treating health care provider. Then, relevant evidence-based medicine, legal precedent, and the ethical theory that applies to the situation are revealed. Often, finding the  best  ethical solution for each problem is automatic, as the solution often becomes self-evident during information-gathering. This general method is reinforced throughout the text with multiple different cases, using a practice-based approach by building on the reader’s developing skills. Additionally, we have sought to emphasize a culturally competent manner in resolving these dilemmas, respectfully addressing issues of age, gender, and culture whenever possible. The main goal of Evidence-Based Medical Ethics: Cases for Practice-Bases Learning is to assist the reader in adapting a patient-centered and evidence-based approach to dilemmas faced in their future practice of medicine.
140118;9780387094304;The Unreal Life of Oscar Zariski;Oscar Zariski's work in mathematics permanently altered the foundations of algebraic geometry. The powerful tools he forged from the ideas of modern algebra allowed him to penetrate classical problems with an unaccustomed depth, and brought new rigor to the intuitive proofs of the Italian School. The students he trained at John Hopkins, and later at Harvard, are among the foremost mathematicians of our time.   While what he called his  real life  is recorded in almost a hundred books and papers, this story of his  unreal life  is based upon Parikh's interviews with his family, colleagues, and students, and on his own memories from a series of tape-recorded interviews made a few years before his death in 1986.   First published in 1991, The Unreal Life of Oscar Zariski was highly successful and widely praised, but has been out of print for many years. Springer is proud to make this book available again, introducing Oscar Zariski to a new generation of mathematicians.   About this book:    I want to express my appreciation to you for having penetrated so deeply into the many-faceted aspects of a complex and mercurial life.    - Yole Zariski, Oscar Zariski's wife    ...an attractive book that recreates one of the great mathematical personalities of our century. Both mathematicians and nonspecialists will enjoy it.    - Doru Stefanescu, Mathematical Reviews    Carol Parikh's perceptive narrative of the life of Oscar Zariski, the man, is based on his own recollections tape recorded a few years before his death, and on the author's extensive interviews with his family, colleagues, and students. Here we learn of his birth in a Jewish settlement in eastern Poland, high school in Russia, university in Rome, and maturity in the United States...We see his development as a mathematician in the context of the people around him. We see his humanity in his love for his family and the care he devoted to his students...All this and more in Carol Parikh's prize-winning English prose make this book a delight to read.     - Robin Hartshorne, American Mathematical Monthly

161532;9781461404361;Brain, Mind and Consciousness;Neuropsychological research on the neural basis of behavior generally asserts that brain mechanisms ultimately suffice to explain all psychologically described phenomena. This assumption stems from the idea that the brain consists entirely of material particles and fields, and that all causal mechanisms relevant to neuroscience can be formulated solely in terms of properties of these elements. Contemporary basic physical theory differs from classic physics on the important matter of how consciousness of human agents enters into the structure of empirical phenomena. The new principles contradict the older idea that local mechanical processes alone account for the structure of all empirical data. Contemporary physical theory brings directly into the overall causal structure certain psychologically described choices made by human agents about how they will act. This key development in basic physical theory is applicable to neuroscience. Brain, Mind and Consciousness: Advances in Neuroscience Research explores this new framework.
161493;9781461401704;Perioperative Addiction;Perioperative Addiction addresses an issue that every anesthesiologist will encounter many times during the course of his or her career:  the patient who arrives for operative care under the influence of legal or illegal drugs.

103748;9781461352297;High Resolution Focused Ion Beams: FIB and its Applications;In this book, we have attempted to produce a reference on high resolution focused ion beams (FIBs) that will be useful for both the user and the designer of FIB instrumentation. We have included a mix of theory and applications that seemed most useful to us. The field of FIBs has advanced rapidly since the application of the first field emission ion sources in the early 1970s. The development of the liquid metal ion source (LMIS) in the late 1960s and early 1970s and its application for FIBs in the late 1970s have resulted in a powerful tool for research and for industry. There have been hundreds of papers written on many aspects of LMIS and FIBs, and a useful and informative book on these subjects was published in 1991 by Phil Prewett and Grame Mair. Because there have been so many new applications and uses found for FIBs in the last ten years we felt that it was time for another book on the subject. 
103077;9781461350231;Global Mobile Satellite Systems;Global Mobile Satellite Systems - A Systems Overview makes mobile satellite communications understandable for communication engineers, candidates for an engineering degree, technicians, managers, and other decision makers such as financiers and regulators. It provides a systems oriented top-level view of mobile satellite communications. In particular, it focuses on Global Mobile Satellite Systems (GMSS) including active programs such as Globalstar, IRIDIUM, ORBCOMM, ACeS, and Thuraya, or so-called the second generation mobile satellite systems class. The authors start with a brief description of three generations of satellite systems in use or planned in the telecommunications industry. Selected systems architectural trades are identified and explained to illustrate how various GMSS systems are formulated, developed and evaluated. It includes an examination of market demand trends, business trades, regulatory issues as well as technical considerations. Major issues are examined in trade study style to provide easy access to key information. Key systems drivers such as orbit trades between LEO's, MEO's, and GEO's, frequency, protocols, customer bases, and regulatory and engineering issues are included.

95821;9781461560531;Plant-microbe Interactions 2;Plant-Microbe Interactions, Volume 2 Volume 1 of this series has made its appearance and dealt forcefully with impor­ tant current topics in the field of plant-microbe interactions. We believe that the quality of those chapters was high and should serve as a focal point for the state of the art as well as an enduring reference. Volume 2 builds upon these accom­ plishments. Chapter 1 discusses the fascinating lipo-chitin signal molecules from Rhizo­ bium, aspects regarding their biosynthesis, and the basis for host specificity. These molecules are a cardinal example of how microorganisms influence plant development and stimulate speculation that they have identified a previously un­ known aspect of plant hormone activity. Chapter 2 continues the discussion of Rhizobium by considering the trafficking of carbon and nitrogen in nodules. Al­ though the ostensible advantage of nodules to plants is the fixation of atmos­ pheric nitrogen, the actual process involved in supplying reduced nitrogen to the plant host is complex.
103313;9780306466717;Signal Transduction in Plants;An understanding of the mechanisms by which plants perceive environmental cues, both physical and chemical, and transduce the signals that influence specific expression of genes, is an area of intensive scientific research. With the completion of the genome sequence of Arabidopsis it is understood now that a larger number of genes encode for proteins involved in signalling cascades and transcription factors. In this volume, different chapters deal with plant receptors, second messengers like calcium ions, phosphoinositides, salicylic acid and nitrous oxide, calcium binding proteins and kinases. In addition to dealing with the response of plants to light, hormones, pathogens, heat, etc. on cellular activity, work currently going on in apoptosis, cell division, and plastid gene expression is also covered in this book.
97156;9780306411410;Thin Film Solar Cells; You, 0 Sun, are the eye of the world You are the soul of all embodied beings You are the source of all creatures You are the discipline of all engaged in work  - Translated from Mahabharata 3rd Century BC Today, energy is the lifeline and status symbol of  civilized  societies. All nations have therefore embarked upon Research and Development pro­ grams of varying magnitudes to explore and effectively utilize renewable sources of energy. Albeit a low-grade energy with large temporal and spatial variations, solar energy is abundant, cheap, clean, and renewable, and thus presents a very attractive alternative source. The direct conver­ sion of solar energy to electricity (photovoltaic effect) via devices called solar cells has already become an established frontier area of science and technology. Born out of necessity for remote area applications, the first commercially manufactured solar cells - single-crystal silicon and thin film CdS/Cu2S - were available well over 20 years ago. Indeed, all space vehicles today are powered by silicon solar cells. But large-scale terrestrial applications of solar cells still await major breakthroughs in terms of discovering new and radical concepts in solar cell device structures, utilizing relatively more abundant, cheap, and even exotic materials, and inventing simpler and less energy intensive fabrication processes. No doubt, this extraordinary challenge in R/D has led to a virtual explosion of activities in the field of photovoltaics in the last several years.
103368;9781461346685;Accretion of Extraterrestrial Matter Throughout Earth’s History;Every year Earth is bombarded with about 40,000 tons of extraterrestrial material. This includes microscopic cosmic dust particles shed by comets and asteroids in outer space, meteorites, as well as large comets and asteroids that have led to catastrophic events in the geologic past. Originally considered only a curiosity, extraterrestrial matter found on Earth provides the only samples we have from comets, asteroids and other planets. Only recently mankind has started to actively collect extraterrestrial matter in space (Apollo program, Stardust mission) rather than to wait for its delivery to Earth. Still, most of our knowledge of the origin and evolution of our solar system is based on careful studies of meteorites, cosmic dust, and traces of large impact events in the geologic record such as the mass extinction that terminated the Cretaceous Period and led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. This book summarizes our current knowledge of the properties, origin, orbital evolution and accretion mechanism of extraterrestrial matter accreted on Earth and sheds light on accretion processes and fluxes in the geologic past. The chapters in the first part of the book are arranged in order to follow extraterrestrial matter from its origin in space, its orbital evolution on its way to Earth, its interaction with the Earth magnetosphere and atmosphere to its more or less violent collision with the Earth's surface. In the second part of the book several chapters deal with the present?day flux of cosmic dust and meteorites to Earth. Finally, several chapters deal with the reconstruction of the accretion history of extraterrestrial matter on Earth, starting with the most recent geologic past and ending with the very early, violent accretion period shortly after the formation of Earth, Moon and other solid planets in our solar system.
103421;9781461513810;Estimating Abundance of African Wildlife;Estimating abundance of wildlife is an essential component of a wildlife research program, and a prerequisite for sound management. With the exception of a few highly mathematical volumes, there are no books on the subject for use by students and field workers. Also, the various techniques for counting animals found in scientific journals are often not accessible to African managers. The unavailability of the diverse literature necessitated the production of a textbook or field manual that covers the ground. The book compiles the most relevant techniques for counting African mammals, illustrated with many examples from the field. It provides guidelines for selecting the appropriate methodology for a range of conditions commonly found in the field, in terms of different animal species, habitat types, and management objectives.
102574;9781461505754;Landscape Erosion and Evolution Modeling;Landscapes are characterized by a wide variation, both spatially and temporally, of tolerance and response to natural processes and anthropogenic stress. These tolerances and responses can be analyzed through individual landscape parameters, such as soils, vegetation, water, etc., or holistically through ecosystem or watershed studies. However, such approaches are both time consuming and costly. Soil erosion and landscape evolution modeling provide a simulation environment in which both the short- and long-term consequences of land-use activities and alternative land use strategies can be compared and evaluated. Such models provide the foundation for the development of land management decision support systems.  Landscape Erosion and Evolution Modeling is a state-of-the-art, interdisciplinary volume addressing the broad theme of soil erosion and landscape evolution modeling from different philosophical and technical approaches, ranging from those developed from considerations of first-principle soil/water physics and mechanics to those developed empirically according to sets of behavioral or empirical rules deriving from field observations and measurements. The validation and calibration of models through field studies is also included.  This volume will be essential reading for researchers in earth, environmental and ecosystem sciences, hydrology, civil engineering, forestry, soil science, agriculture and climate change studies. In addition, it will have direct relevance to the public and private land management communities.
95737;9781489925077;Fundamentals of Superconductivity;The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity has resulted in a remarkable growth in the amount of research and the number of researchers working in this exciting field. Superconductivity is not a new phenomenon: in 1991 it will be 80 years old. Even though it was the newer discoveries which motivated us to write this book, the book itself is mainly a description of the fundamentals of the phenomenon. The book is written for a very broad audience, including students, engin­ eers, teachers, scientists, and others who are interested in learning about this exciting frontier of science. We have focused on the qualitative aspects, so that the reader can develop a basic understanding of the fundamental physics without getting bogged down in the details. Because of this approach, our list of refer­ ences is not comprehensive, and it is supplemented with a summary of additional reading consisting of monographs and selected review articles. (The articles we have referenced were either not reflected in the review articles on monographs or were milestones in the development of the field. ) In addition, some of the sections which can be skipped during the first reading have been marked with asterisks (*). Until recently, superconductivity was considered to belong to the field of low-temperature physics. This field was born, simultaneously with quantum physics, at the beginning of this century. Initially these two contemporaneous fields developed independently, but they soon became strongly coupled.
95193;9780306437304;Organic Superconductivity;This book contains papers presented at the International Conference on Organic Superconductivity which was held May 20-24, 1990, at the Stanford Sierra Conference Center, South Lake Tahoe, California. In the twenty years since the First Conference on Organic Superconductivity was held (Hawaii, 1969), there has been remarkable progress in the field. At present, development is accelerating with contributions from many groups in many countries worldwide. The discovery of high Tc superconductivity by G. Bednorz and K. Muller in 1986 and subsequent developments in the ceramic superconductors have had an enormous impact on the field of superconductivity as a whole. This discovery occurred in an area entirely different from that of conventional superconduc­ tivity, underscoring the importance of the search for and study of novel materials of all kinds. We believe that the organics, with their wide range of structural, chemical, and physical properties, belong in this category of novel materials. This book reflects the efforts of researchers from various disciplines: physicists, chemists, and materials scientists. It addresses the normal and superconducting properties of organic materials, as well as the search for new compounds and new syntheses. We are pleased to note that one of these papers reports on the discovery of a new organic superconductor with a record high Tc in this class. One chapter is devoted to a comparison of organic superconductors and the cuprates, another, to the prospects of discovering other novel conducting or superconducting compounds.
103123;9780834212589;Citrus Processing;Citrus juices are the most common among the fruit juices around the world and constitute a major portion of the food industry. Even though juice-processing technology has been around for many years, interest in historical and modem in­ novations and applications is widespread. New juice enterprises are springing up constantly all over the world. Old enterprises are constantly undergoing change, growth, and development. The Internet has expanded the reach of many, not only for information but for marketing and production alterations. The World Wide Web has made the wide world one. Computer technology alone is growing faster than the oranges on the trees. With these multifaceted changes, a need has emerged for an update to the first edition of Citrus Processing. The second edition of Citrus Processing has expanded its scope beyond the quality control theme of the first edition. I have used a more holistic approach to the subject of citrus processing. Those using this text in the classroom will find it more comprehensive in its treatment of the subject. The first edition targeted the industrial technologist. The second edition approaches citrus processing as a complete subject, assuming an audience interested in learning from the ground up. This new approach should be particularly appealing to those unfamiliar with the industry. Even so, experienced industrialists will find the information con­ tained here contemporary, futuristic, and fundamental.

Particular emphasis is laid on programming the finite element method to incorporate applications of da- mage mechanics. This textbook for graduates and researchers in civil, mechanical, aerospace engineering and materials science deals with the practical applications of damage mechanics, which have not appeared before in the literature. The book contains research on the separation of voids and cracks in continuum damage mechanics. An educational version of a finite element program for damage mechanics is included on a CD-ROM.
66764;9784431669173;Myopia Updates II;The incidence of myopia continues its rapid rise worldwide, and although the mechanism has not been fully clarified, there has been a significant increase in knowledge of the condition in recent years. Important questions about myopia are being posed by researchers across a broad spectrum of disciplinesfrom psychology to molecular biology, from corneal surgery to retinal physiology, and from genetics to experimental optics. The Seventh International Conference on Myopia, held in Taipei in November 1998, provided a forum for researchers and practitioners to make presentations and participate in discussions of their latest findings. Many doctors from Asian countries, where the incidence of myopia is particularly high, reported the results of their work. Myopia Updates II presents the latest information on epidemiology, risk factors, complications, experimentation, and treatment, and is a valuable resource for all who are interested in myopia and ocular growth.
67907;9783642621130;Advanced Monte Carlo for Radiation Physics, Particle Transport Simulation and Applications;This book focusses on the state of the art of Monte Carlo methods in radiation physics and particle transport simulation and applications, the latter involving in particular, the use and development of electron--gamma, neutron--gamma and hadronic codes. Besides the basic theory and the methods employed, special attention is paid to algorithm development for modeling, and the analysis of experiments and measurements in a variety of fields ranging from particle to medical physics.
67933;9781447104575;Systems Engineering for Business Process Change;A very large proportion of commercial and industrial concerns in the UK find their business competitiveness dependent on huge quantities of already installed, legacy IT. Often the nature of their business is such that, to remain competitive, they have to be able to change their business processes. Sometimes the required change is radical and revolutionary, but more often the required change is incremental. For such incremental change, a major systems engineering problem arises. The cost and delay involved in changing the installed IT to meet the changed business requirements is much too high. In order to address this issue the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) set up, in 1996, a managed research programme entitled Systems Engineering for Business Process Change (SEBPC). I was appointed as co-ordinator of the programme. The overall aim of this new managed research programme was to release the full potential of IT as an enabler of business process change, and to overcome the disabling effects which the build-up of legacy systems has on such change. As such, this aim addressed a stated objective of the Information Technology and Computer Science (IT&CS) part of EPSRC to encourage research at a system level.
67837;9781447104650;Applications and Innovations in Intelligent Systems VII;Following on from a three-year knowledge management project, seven organisations formed aco-operative group for knowledge management. This group meets through the Knowledge Management Implementers Forum (KMIF). Each of the organisations participating in this work are, by implication, interested in the development of KM. The aims of the forum are t9 exchange ideas and share experience in the areaofknowledge management. The organisations involved are: ~ British Aerospace (Samlesbury) ~ ICI ~ ICL ~ North WestWater ~ IDS Cad-Graphics ~ Liverpool John Moores University ~ NWAIAG (Blackburn College) 1.1 The Organisations Involved Each ofthe organisations has specific reasons for being involved in this project and in KM. The British Aerospace Samlesbury site is a large manufacturing site employing ground breaking technology for Europe's front line military aircraft. The factory works with a well-managed supply chain and works closely with other British Aerospace sites in the manufacture of aircraft components. It has set up a partnership with another Aerospace Company based on exchange of knowledge and therefore needs to value that knowledge. ICI is one of the UK's leading chemical companies and plays on an international stage. Changes in international supply and demand require ICI to respond quickly to market pressures. This means that the company needs to use its knowledge assets in a well managed way and put systems in place that increase the flexibility and ensure the security ofthese important assets.

67161;9788847000674;Advances in the Immunopathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis;P.A. MURARO, A. LUGARESI, D. GAMBI Many of the pathological aspects of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions have been known for over a century. It is only recently, however, that different patterns of demyelination have been linked to distinct pathways of immune-mediated tissue destruction. In particular, the inter-individual heterogeneity of MS lesions has suggested that different mechanisms may act in different patients, accounting for the variability observed in clinical course, immunological findings in peripheral blood and cere­ brospinal fluid (CSF), and response to immunomodulatory treatments. To provide an overview of the basic mechanisms possibly involved in MS lesion initiation and development, an international meeting was organized in the context of the annual Congress of the Italian Neuroimmunology Association (AINI), held at the University of Chieti, in Chieti Italy on 29 October 1998. The high standard of presentations prompted us to report them in extended form, to highlight recent pro­ gress in the understanding of basic mechanisms sustaining MS immuno­ pathogenesis. A central role in the possible mechanisms leading to myelin destruc­ tion has been attributed to T lymphocytes reactive to myelin antigens. Studies on the myelin antigen-specific T cell repertoire have contributed significant advances to our knowledge of autoimmunity (Chapters 1,2).

95787;9780412097317;Single Event Phenomena;This monograph is written for neophytes, students, and practitioners to aid in their understanding of single event phenomena. It attempts to collect the highlights as well as many of the more detailed aspects of this field into an entity that portrays the theoretical as well as the practical applications of this subject. Those who claim that  theory  is not for them can skip over the earlier chapters dealing with the fundamental and theoretical portions and find what they need in the way of hands-on guidelines and pertinent formulas in the later chapters. Perhaps, after a time they will return to peruse the earlier chapters for a more complete rendition and appreciation of the subject matter. It is felt that the reader should have some acquaintance with the electronics of semiconductors and devices, some broad atomic physics introduction, as well as a respectable level of mathematics through calculus, including simple differential equations. A large part of the preceding can be obtained informally, through job experience, self-study, evening classes, as well as from a formal college curriculum.
91595;9781461562252;Auditory User Interfaces;Auditory User Interfaces: Toward the Speaking Computer describes a speech-enabling approach that separates computation from the user interface and integrates speech into the human-computer interaction. The Auditory User Interface (AUI) works directly with the computational core of the application, the same as the Graphical User Interface.  The author's approach is implemented in two large systems, ASTER - a computing system that produces high-quality interactive aural renderings of electronic documents - and Emacspeak - a fully-fledged speech interface to workstations, including fluent spoken access to the World Wide Web and many desktop applications. Using this approach, developers can design new high-quality AUIs.  Auditory interfaces are presented using concrete examples that have been implemented on an electronic desktop. This aural desktop system enables applications to produce auditory output using the same information used for conventional visual output.  Auditory User Interfaces: Toward the Speaking Computer is for the electrical and computer engineering professional in the field of computer/human interface design. It will also be of interest to academic and industrial researchers, and engineers designing and implementing computer systems that speak. Communication devices such as hand-held computers, smart telephones, talking web browsers, and others will need to incorporate speech-enabling interfaces to be effective.
102803;9781475776379;Corporate Governance in a Globalising World: Convergence or Divergence?;Corporate Governance In A Globalising World: Convergence Or Divergence? presents a broad and multi-disciplinary debate on corporate governance systems by integrating academic viewpoints, statistical evidence, as well as field surveys. Based on a large number of publications and studies, the opinions of researchers are grouped into three categories: those that believe in a convergence into the direction of the market-oriented model (with the Anglo-American model as the reference base), those that opt for another type of convergence, namely in the direction of a hybrid corporate governance model (based on cross-reference between different leading governance models), and those that do not believe in global convergence but adhere to diversity of governance models.
103130;9781475782028;Fundamentals of Clinical Practice;Fundamentals of Clinical Practice, Second Edition presents medical students with a comprehensive guide to the social ramifications of a physician's work, and more experienced practitioners with the tools to augment their own patient-centered techniques.
103224;9780751402032;Advances in Food Colloids;The field of food colloids is concerned with the physical chemistry of food systems viewed as assemblies of particles and macromolecules in various states of supramolecular and microscopic organization. The objective is to relate the equilibrium and dynamic properties of the system to the inter­ actions amongst the constituent molecular and particulate entities. The emphasis is on structure and kinetics at the colloidal scale, and with the distribution of molecular food components (proteins, lipids, poly­ saccharides, etc.) between dispersed and continuous bulk phases (water, fat, air, etc.) and various kinds of interfaces (oil-water, air-water, etc.). Food products such as butter, cheese, ice-cream, margarine, mayonnaise of food colloids. and yoghurt are all examples This book describes some recent experimental and theoretical develop­ ments in the field of food colloids. By way of background, we start with a brief survey of the current consumer trends which may point the way towards future research opportunities in the field. Chapter 1 also attempts to illustrate the way in which advances in instrumental methods and experimental investigations of well-defined mixed protein-surfactant systems are offering new insights into the structure of protein adsorbed layers and the competitive adsorption of proteins in oil-in-water emulsion systems.
102891;9780412459306;Food and Feed from Legumes and Oilseeds;Oilseeds and legumes provide a significant proportion of the protein and energy requirements of the world population. This important new book provides comprehensive details of the main oil seed and legume crops focusing particularly on the nutritional aspects of these crops which are, or have the potential to be, more widely exploited in developing countries where are or have the potential to be, more widely exploited in developing countries where protein and energy malnutrition continue to escalate. The predicted rapid rise of populations in many world regions which are increasingly vulnerable to food shortages means that a full knowledge of the nutritional significance of available crops is vital in helping to prevent potential calamities. Food and Feed from Legumes and Oil Seeds has been written by a team of international contributors, each with direct experience of these important crops and their nutritional merits, and the editors are both international experts in the crops covered. This book will become of great value to nutritionists, food and feed scientists and technologists, agricultural scientists and all those involved with overseas developments and food aid organizations.
98224;9781461376811;Fundamentals of Clinical Practice;Fundamentals of Clinical Practice is an introductory textbook focusing on the patient­ physician relationship. Formerly closeted behind closed doors, this most intimate of healing relationships is coming under increasing scientific scrutiny. Physicians and other healthcare providers are beginning to understand the critical importance of this relation­ ship to the health of patients, as well as to larger societal relationships, systems, and values. To facilitate the reader's exploration of the patient-physician relationship, all chap­ ters include numerous illustrative cases and conclude with cases for discussion that allow small groups of learners to tackle these difficult issues. Our hypothesis is that through discussion a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the patient-physician relationship will allow medical students and other future healthcare providers to form more effective therapeutic relationships with their patients. Part I of this textbook,  The Patient,  explores the relationship through the patient's perspective, with chapters on human health and disease and individual and family devel­ opment. Understanding the patient's perspective is critical to establishing a sound thera­ peutic relationship. The day when a physician could maintain solely a disease or techno­ logical perspective is fading fast under the weight of patient criticism, particularly in primary care fields. Patients judge such a disease or technological perspective as less humane and frequently vote with their feet, finding other physicians who are much better able to balance the caring aspects of medicine with the curing.
92783;9780412993312;Biosyntheses;This book emphasizes the importance of microbial physiology, biochemistry, genetics, and evolution in the study of biosynthesis. It takes into account the considerable advances made in the field in the last twenty years by the introduction of gene cloning and sequencing and by the exponential development of physical methods such as X-ray crystallography of proteins.
103628;9781461348962;Proteomics and Nanocrystallography;The book addresses the most recent developments in structural and functional proteomics underlying the recent contributions given in these areas by our laboratory to the instrumentations, the methods and the procedures as mutuated from the nanoscale sciences and technologies. These developments introduced in the last few years make now possible protein massive identification (mass spectrometry and biomolecular arrays down to nanoamounts) and protein structural characterization in solution and in crystals down to the atomic scale to an extent and to a degree so far unmatched. Emphasis is placed in the growth by nanobiofilm template of protein crystals of any type and size from millimeter to micron, leading in combination with microfocus synchrotron technology and atomic force microscopy to the definition of a new field called nanocrystallography. The few useful examples being shown, concerning yet structurally unsolved proteins, point this very promising approach nanotechnology-based in structural proteomics using highly focused X-rays. This has not to be confused with the important study of nanocrystals, both organic and inorganic, and novel diamond like nanocomposite materials and devices having 3D protein crystals as matrices to be equilibrated with nanoparticles/gold/silver to be utilized in the most diversified electronic applications here also summarized. vii Acknowledgments We are particularly grateful to Giuseppe Zanotti at the University of Padova for his fundamental collaboration during all the crystallographic studies.

This book reviews the state-of-the-art knowledge and touches upon cutting edge newer and improved applications especially in the area of network modeling. It is aimed at an audience ranging from students, academics, basic researcher and clinicians in cancer research. This book is expected to benefit the field of translational cancer medicine by bridging the gap between basic researchers, computational biologists and clinicians who have one ultimate goal and that is to defeat cancer.
116664;9789067041270;Minority Rights in Europe:European Minorities and Languages;According to some sources there are around 5,000 national minority groups living in the contemporary world, and about 3,000 linguistic groups. However, this is probably a discretionary assessment as it seems that there are no exact figures with respect to the number and size of minority groups. The existing estimates are usually based on different and sometimes not very clear criteria and mostly take into account those groups and numbers which are the result of the individual choice of a person and are not based exclusively on the objective differences. Notwithstanding this, a brief calculation would indicate that in Western Europe 14. 7% of the total population belongs to minority groups, and the same percentage exists in the Central and Eastern European region - 14. 7%, whereas in the countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States this percentage is slightly higher - at 18. 9%. Throughout the history of the European continent minorities have had a significant impact on political stability and security. Currently, most of the situations of internal tension as well as conflicts, whether internal or international, involve inter-ethnic relations. Thus the international community at large and - for the European minorities more importantly - the European institutions have placed minority issues high on their 'agenda.
116621;9789067041393;Regional Trade Agreements in the GATT/WTO:Artical XXIV and the Internal Trade Requirement;The economic theory of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs), or discriminatory trade liberalization for and among a subset ofnations, was first analyzed with fun­ damental and startling insight by Jacob Viner (1950). He destroyed the intuition that any move towards free trade was welfare-enhancing, for the country itself or for the world, or for both. He introduced us memorably to the notion of trade di­ verting -- and here, he meant not diversion in the old and approving sense of en­ tertainment but in the modern and castigating sense ofdistorting - Free Trade Ar­ eas (FTAs) and Customs Unions (CUs). In other words, in the economists'jargon, discriminatory approaches to freeing trade were not monotonically welfare-im­ proving. The legal scholars of GATT and trade law, chiefly the giants Robert Hudec, John Jackson and Kenneth Dam in the United States, were quick to follow suit. Their classic writings on Article XXIV ofthe GATT,which provides an exception to the MFN obligation for contracting parties provided they go all the way and cre­ ate FTAs and CUs which are supposed to reduce internal trade barriers fully rath­ er than settle for a lesser preferential arrangement, are still a pleasure to read. They are in the best tradition of a creative interaction between the economic and the le­ gal disciplines. Indeed, today, as my own work with Robert Hudec, resulting in a major two-volume publication by MIT Press underlines, that interaction has be­ come yet more profound.
47182;9780387945712;Essential AutoLISP®;AutoCAD is the most widely used computer-aided design package in the world. Underneath AutoCAD is a powerful computing language called AutoLISP.

40535;9783642782237;Amlodipine; Those who choose to increase their knowledge still further by reading ... will discover an exciting new world.   NOEL WHITTAKER, in  Making Money Made Simple  1989. The development of calcium antagonists has recently been described as representing  one of the major advances in cardiovascular thera­ peutics of the latter half of the twentieth century  (Braunwald, 1990). However, although the development of these drugs started in the mid­ nineteen sixties it is only recently that their real potential has begun to be appreciated. Even now the calcium antagonist saga is not complete, since new compounds continue to appear and new therapeutic applica­ tions emerge. Based on the experience gained in the clinics in which these drugs have been used recognition is being given now to the need to improve upon the prototypes of the group. Such improvement is resulting in the development and production not only of long-acting formulations of the prototypes (nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem) but also of new calcium antagonists with improved tissue selectivity, potency and duration of action. To those of us who are interested in this field such a development is both exciting and rewarding. As far as the clinicians who prescribe these drugs are concerned the long-acting nature of some of the newer calcium antagonists should make the satisfactory management of their patients an achievable goal.
138106;9789401776813;A Journey through Statistical Physics;This book contains selected papers of Jürg Fröhlich, one of the most outstanding mathematical physicists of our time, on the subject of statistical mechanics. In an extensive introduction, Jürg Fröhlich sets his results into a wider context and gives precious information on the genesis of his work from both a historical and a methodological perspective. It is not only an overview of current and future research directions in statistical mechanics, but also relates this subject with other branches of contemporary physics and mathematics. All papers in this collection bear Jürg Fröhlich’s signature in terms of a delicate balance between mathematical rigor and physical significance. They cover thirty years of his work on statistical physics, ranging from the most basic foundational questions in atomism and thermodynamics via the description of phase transitions and critical phenomena up to disordered systems and the study of many-body systems in condensed matter physics, including the quantum Hall effect. The wide range of topics covered in this compendium reflects the breadth of Jürg Fröhlich’s interests, and the last chapters reveal an outlook towards some of his more recent research areas.
8504;9783540072294;Patch Testing;The patch test (epicutaneous test) and photo patch test are used to clarify the etiology and diagnosis of allergic as well as light-potentiated contact der­ matitis. The patch test must be correlated with historic data and physical ex­ amination. Contact dermatitis constitutes a significant proportion (5%-15%) of the dis­ eases at dermatologic clinics. If the results are to be reliable, patch tests should be performed properly and the technique should not be varied in an arbitrary manner. The examiner should adhere strictly to the standard procedure so as to understand its possibilities and its limitations. Interpretation of the actual patch test reactions places high demands on the experience and skill of the examiner and on his knowledge of chemistry and pharmacology. This monograph is concerned only with the patch test method used to demonstrate the existence of contact allergy and light-potentiated contact allergy. It does not describe the  prophetic patch test  ( predictive patch test ), which is used to demonstrate the sensitizing capacity of a substance. The terminology in the text is that recommended by the International Con­ tact Dermatitis Research Group. (In this book dermatitis = eczema.) 1.2 Historic Development Joseph Jadassohn devised the epicutaneous test. In 1895 he tested a syphilitic patient who developed a cutaneous eruption after treatment with mercury ointment.
105927;9780387300443;Process Assessment and Improvement;Process Assessment and Improvement: A Practical Guide, Second Edition, provides a powerful and practical approach to improving organizations through process assessment, combined with people factors such as organizational culture and team-based improvement.

126517;9781573402170;Atlas of Echocardiography;Echocardiography has become the premier diagnostic imaging modality in clinical cardiology, and continues to push the frontiers of science through newer techniques, such as three-dimensional imaging, contrast imaging, tissue Doppler imaging. The Atlas of Echocardiography is dedicated to techniques and protocols, hemodynamics and physics. It covers anatomic and flow applications in disease states, the role of echocardiography in clinical situations such as intensive care units or operating rooms, and finally targeted imaging, which is an exciting developing application.
107649;9781461358473;Computerized Food Processing Operations;This book is designed to explain and illustrate how food processing op­ erations can be made more efficient and profitable through the application of computers in the laboratory, pilot plant, and production plant floor of industrial food processing plants. It is intended to provide a sufficient un­ derstanding of how computer system concepts can be applied to food pro­ cessing operations to permit technical managers, with the assistance of food engineering professionals, to identify, develop, and implement com­ puter applications to meet their own specific needs. The book should also serve as a useful text or guide for students in food engineering or food technology seeking a practical course on food process automation at the undergraduate-graduate level interface. The material covered includes the use of microcomputers for automated data acquisition and analysis in the laboratory and pilot plant, followed by the use of computer-based process control systems on the production plant floor. Higher-level applications are also included to illustrate the use of engineering software containing mathematical models for computer simulation, optimization, and intelligent on-line control of specific food processing unit operations.
87885;9789401019231;Conduction and breakdown in dielectric liquids;The aim of the 5th international conference on conduction and breakdown of dielectric liquids is the same as that of the preceding conferences, namely to have a forum where all experts in this vast field can meet, can present their latest results and can exchange their ideas. It comes within this framework that the subjects of this conference cover the whole field of conduction and breakdown of polar and non polar liquids, including cryogenic liquids. In comparison with many other international conferences this is a relatively small one. This fact has the great advantage that all participants can be lodged in the congress centre  De Leeuwenhorst  at Noordwijkerhout. The result is that everybody who wants to talk about a problem with a colleague can easily contact him and make an appointment. When the organizing committee, whose members are J.M. Goldschvartz, chairman, A.K. Niessen and W.Boone began their task, the first idea was to organize the conference in the Aula complex of the Delft University of Technology, since the conference is sponsored by the Department of Applied Physics of the university. Then the participants had to be lodged not only in Delft but also in surrounding towns as the number of hotel beds in Delft is very limited. Thus, the decision to move into  De Leeuwenhorst  was practical and wise.
88035;9789400964150;QSAR in Environmental Toxicology;Ever since Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, we have generally become aware of environmental contaminants and their effects on the ecosystem. The findin~ of PCB's in fish by Soren Jensen in Sweden, the recognition of mirex as contaminant in fish from Lake Ontario, and the discoveries of contaminant laden leachates from dumpsites such as the Love Canal have become milestones in the search for and charac­ terization of contaminants in our environment. At this time, the problem no longer is so much the identifi­ cation of contaminants and their sources. Rather, we are now faced with solving questions on the fates and effects of such compounds. This includes the search for mechanisms to deal effectively with the large number of chemicals already found in water, air and biota. One of such time and cost saving scientific avenues is the field of quantitative structure-activity correlations for the prediction of the environmental behavior and effects of compounds.
83491;9780792339588;The Centenary of a Paper on Slow Viscous Flow by the Physicist H.A. Lorentz;This book commemorates the appearance one hundred years ago of a paper on slow viscous flow, written by the physicist and Nobel laureate H.A. Lorentz. Although Lorentz is not remembered by most as a fluid dynamicist - indeed, his fame rests primarily on his contributions to the theory of electrons, electrodynamics and early developments in relativity - his fluid-mechanics paper of 1896 contains many ideas which have remained important in fluid mechanics to this very day. In that short paper he put forward his reciprocal theorem (an integral-equation formulation which is used extensively nowadays in boundary-element calculations) and his reflection theorem. Furthermore, he must be credited with the invention of the stokeslet.  The contributors to this book have all made their mark in slow viscous flow. Each of these authors highlights further developments of one of Lorentz's ideas. There are applications in sintering, micropolar fluids, bubbles, locomotion of microorganisms, non-Newtonian fluids, drag calculations, etc. Other contributions are of a more theoretical nature, such as the flow due to an array of stokeslets, the interaction between a drop and a particle, the interaction of a particle and a vortex, the reflection theorem for other geometries, a disk moving along a wall and a higher-order investigation.  Lorentz's paper of 1896 is also included in an English translation. An introductory paper puts Lorentz's work in fluid mechanics in a wider perspective. His other great venture in fluid mechanics - his theoretical modelling on the enclosure of the Zuyderzee - is also discussed. The introduction also presents a short description of Lorentz's life and times. It was Albert Einstein who said of Lorentz that he was `...the greatest and noblest man of our time'.
4470;9783642697777;Environmental Research and Protection;Inorganic chemical pollutants such as S02 and NO. , which also act as the major precursors of acid rain, as well as ecotoxic heavy metals and metalloids (cadmium, lead, mercury, copper, zinc, nickel, chromium, arsenic, selenium etc. ) have gained considerable significance as regards the ecotoxic burden on vegetation, soil and natural waters, and as air pollutants. The rapid increase that has recently been noticed in severe damage to forests has suddenly aroused public interest in the ever-growing problem of inorganic chemical pollutants to a hitherto unknown extent, especially as in addition to the damage to vegetation, this also constitutes a growing hazard for man via food chains. Research on the level, fate and transfer as well as on the ecotoxic and toxic impact of inorganic pollutants has therefore gained considerable significance in science and furthermore as a sound scientific basis for relevant environmental protection regulations, in research politics and in public awareness.

Yotaro Hatamura and 40 others who studied in his laboratory put together this eye-opening book that analyzes more than 100 cases of failures, with the information arranged so that readers can easily understand what happened, why, and how not to repeat the mistakes. The cases covered here range from those from the writers own experience to catastrophes well known worldwide. The book lays the foundation for what is now called Shippaigaku, the way to research accidents, scandals, and other failures to uncover the root cause, reveal the scenario that led to the unwanted event, describe what happened so readers can clearly repeat the steps in their mind, and propose ways to avoid those mistakes in the future. Engineering designers and managers will shape their knowledge into real skills by learning from others failures. 
95369;9781461550914;Business Process Engineering;Due to growing concern about the competitiveness of industry in the international marketplace and the efficiency ofgovernment enterprises, widespread initiatives are currently underway to enhance thecompetitive posture offirms and to streamline government operations. Nearly all enterprises are engaged in assessing ways in which their productivity, product quality and operations can be improved. These efforts canbe described as Business Process Engineering (BPE). BPE had its roots in industry under differing titIes: Process Improvement, Process Simplification, Process Innovation, Reengineering, etc. It has matured to be an important ingredient of successful enterprises in the private and public sectors. After extensive exploitation by industrial and governmental practitioners and consultants, it is attracting increasing attention from academics in the fields of engineering and business. However, even with all of this attention in the popular literature, serious scholarly literature on BPE is in short supply. TItis is somewhat surprising, especially since so many large international organizations have attempted BPE projectswith varied success.

166518;9781461447795;Addressing Unhealthy Alcohol Use in Primary Care;While there is a wealth of published information on addiction medicine, the psychological aspects of alcohol abuse, and behavioral medicine with regard to addiction, virtually none of the existing resources were written with the primary care provider in mind.  Addressing Unhealthy Alcohol Use in Primary Care is a handy reference for primary care clinicians who are confronted by patients with these problems daily, and who wish to successfully address these issues in their practice.  Focusing on the literature and science relevant to practicing providers, this book covers the range of interventions appropriate for this setting.  Topics include assessment, brief counseling interventions, pharmacotherapy, referrals to both specialty care and Alcoholics Anonymous (and other self-help programs), psychiatric comorbidity and other drug use, and other information specific to the needs of the primary care clinician.  The vast majority of people with health risks and consequences related to alcohol use receive little to no attention from healthcare, despite the fact that alcohol is a leading cause of early preventable death.  This book is a guide to identifying and addressing unhealthy alcohol use in hopes of improving the lives of patients.

107618;9781461521037;Fruit Processing;Fruit and fruit products, in all their many varieties and variations, are major world commodities and part of the economic life blood of many countries, particularly in the developing world. The perception of the healthy nature of fruit is a major reason for its increased consumption in the developed world, and many consumers today find a wider selection of fruit varieties, available at all times of the year, than ever before. This volume, however, is not so much concerned with fresh fruit as those principal areas of processing to which it may be subjected. Fruit processing arose as a means of utilising a short-lived product and preserving its essential nutritional qualities as far as possible. A chapter on the nutritional aspects of fruit is included in this work to reflect the importance of this topic to most consumers. After a general introduction, the chapter on fruit storage is the only contribution which deals with a process from which fruit emerges in essentially the same physical condition. Beyond that the book sets out to cover most of the major areas in which fruit may be processed into forms which bear varying semblances to the original raw material.
87950;9789401054188;Simulation of Thermal Systems;The events leading up to the publication of this book started effectively in 1976 with the exchange of information between those modelling teams in Europe which were involved in the R&D-programme on Solar Energy of the Commission. When it became clear that the availability of experimental datafor model validation wm next to nothing, the Commission took the initiative to support in the frame of the Solar Energy R&D-programme the construction of Solar Pilot Test Facilities on eight sites in Europe. Each experimental facility consisted of two real solar heating systems with collectors, storage, controls, and msociated piping, but with the dwelling thermal distribution system replaced by a physical load simulator. One of the two systems on each site wm a reference system and wm identical for the eight participating teams. The simulator wm capable of producing a typical themalload for a house, interactive with the actual weather, and took into account the effects of the occupants. With datafrom these facilities not only were national simulation programs validated, but also the meanwhile commonly accepted modular structured European program EMGPl wm validated. EMGPl, which only could be run on a mainframe computer or under special conditions on a mini-computer,formed in tum the bmis for the development of EURSOL andEMGP3.EMGP3 is an improved userjriendly programpackagejorpersonal computers derived jrom EMGPl and includes a unique and user jriendly preprocessor.
82652;9789401058735;StarGuides 2001;StarGuides 2001 is the enlarged and updated version of a long line of directories published since 1978 (see e.g. Heck 1995 & 1997) and gathering together all practical data available on associations, societies, scientific committees, agencies, companies, institutions, universities, etc., and more generally organizations, involved in astronomy and space sciences. Many other types of entries have also been included such as academies, advisory and expert committees, bibliographic services, consultants, data and documentation centres, dealers, distributors, funding agencies and organizations, journals, manufacturers, meteorological services, museums, norms and standards offices, planetariums, public observatories, publishers, research institutions in related fields, software producers and distributors, etc. Besides astronomy and space sciences, related fields such as aeronautics, aeronomy, astronautics, atmospheric sciences, chemistry, communications, computer sciences, data processing, education, electronics, energetics, engineering, environment, geodesy, geophysics, information retrieval, management, mathematics, meteoro­ logy, optics, physics, remote sensing, and so on, are also covered when justified. The basic philosophy of this directory (and of other products in the Star*s Family) is to provide practical data which one seeks to always have at ones disposal. Over the years they have proved to not only be valuable auxiliaries for improving national and international relationships, but also to be efficient tools for helping laypersons and public bodies to contact organizations easily.
94121;9781851667703;Principles of the Austenitization of Steels;This book introduces the principles of the response of steels to the austenitizing process and is intended to act as a source book for information and review purposes for metallurgists, metallurgical engineers and other materials scientists.
92202;9789400973589;Injection Moulding Materials;In order to make the subject manageable the term 'injection moulding' has been restricted in its use so that only those processes which rely on thermal softening of the polymeric materials have been described and discussed in this book. It is intended to discuss the subject of reaction injection moulding in a separate book. However, even with this omission, the subject is still a very large one as nowadays many sorts or types of polymers are injection moulded. For example, it is estimated that one-third of all plastics materials are injection moulded-the range of products produced is enormous and increases daily. Because most moulding materials are based on plastics, in particular thermoplastics, the materials guides which form a large part of this book concentrate on the moulding of thermoplastics materials. Such guides should only be treated as general guidelines as each of the materials is normally available in a wide range of grades. These may differ in polymer molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, the additives used and their concentration, the physical form of the moulding compound, etc. A wide range of processing behaviours and end-use properties is therefore possible from any of the materials listed. This versatility is typified by the rubbery polymers which are compounded into an incredibly wide range of compounds. Because of this versatility only a very general guideline has been given for such materials.
97353;9780412586200;Groundwater Quality;Groundwater quality monitoring and testing is of paramount importance both in the developed and developing world. This book presents a series of papers illustrating the varied nature of current research into groundwater quality. Urban and rural supplies are covered through a case history approach, and the importance of remedial action to prevent deterioration is emphasized.
88340;9789401016667;A Discourse on Novelty and Creation;Over the past two decades, the number of studies of creativity has in­ creased enormously. Although these studies represent a wide variety of perspectives, the largest proportion of them falls within the province of the social and behavioral sciences. Perhaps this is due to the impetus of experimental psychologists, who recognized the special problems that arise when originality is treated under a general theory of cognition. But what­ ever the reason, human creativity has come to be viewed as one of the major concerns of the twentieth century. It has been referred to as the most pressing problem of our time. In spite of the importance of the topic, few philosophers have either analyzed or speculated systematically about creativity, as a distinct topic. This neglect may be the expression of a tacit and sometimes explicit con­ viction that creativity must be taken for granted and not subjected to analytic scrutiny. In any case, the determination of so many behavioral and social scientists not to fall behind in the search for understanding creativity has led to a proliferation of publications that are unrelated to one another and that lack dearly ordered and reflective consideration of what creativity is. Too few writers have either acknowledged or examined what they presuppose about creative acts, about human activity, and a­ bout the nature of explanation when they focus on so complex a phenome­ non as creativity.
59219;9783540630920;Extracorporeal Shock Waves in Orthopaedics;The application of extracorporeal shock waves in the locomotor apparatus offers new therapeutic concepts.

Furthermore they report on first experiences with shock wave therapy in children with cerebral paresis.
23769;9783540500889;Coordinates in Geodesy;In Coordinates in Geodesy definitions and transformations are treated based on the general principles of differential geometry for surfaces and three-dimensional Euclidean space, strictly using the tensor calculus. The broad approach applying general concepts of constructing and transforming coordinates allows clearly arranged solutions for all geodetic applications. Moreover, the great number of examples given in this book explain in detail the principles of coordinates in geodetic surveying using ellipsoids of revolution as reference surfaces.
222431;9783642330803;Beyond Data Protection;The book deals with data protection issues from practical viewpoints. 40% of the content focus on the Malaysian Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) 2010 progress, whilst 60% of the content focus on leading comparative practical guidance from Europe. Part of the PDPA provisions is mirrored from European approaches and practices. The approach of this book is straightforward, handy and readable and is supplemented by practical applications, illustrations, tables and diagrams. Practical examples highlighted in this book range from cloud computing, radio frequency identification technology, social media networks and information security to basic related aspects of data protection issues covering strategic leadership, management, governance and audit in businesses, organisations and local authorities.

The book is equally suitable for academics, practitioners, governmental officials and regulators dealing with data protection within their sector-specific legislation.
137266;9781849966962;Biodiesel;Environmental and political concerns are generating a growing interest in alternative engine fuels such as biodiesel. Biodiesel is a renewable energy source produced from natural oils and fats, which can be used as a substitute for petroleum diesel without the need for diesel engine modification. In addition to being biodegradable and non-toxic, biodiesel is also essentially free of sulfur and aromatics, producing lower exhaust emissions than conventional gasoline whilst providing similar properties in terms of fuel efficiency. The greatest drawback of using pure vegetable oils as fuels are their high viscosity, although this can be reduced by techniques such as dilution, micro-emulsification, pyrolysis or transesterification. Of these processes, the transesterification of vegetable oil triglycerides in supercritical methanol has been shown to be particularly promising, producing high yields of low-viscosity methyl esters without the need of a catalyst. Furthermore, these methyl esters have considerably lower flash points than those of pure vegetable oils. Biodiesel: A Realistic Fuel Alternative for Diesel Engines describes the production and characterization of biodiesel, along with current experimental research work in the field. The book will be of great interest to advanced undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers in renewable energy, as well as to fuel engineers.
132761;9781848829268;Clinical Approach to Sudden Cardiac Death Syndromes;Clinical cardiologists are encountering an important challenge in the care of families with inherited cardiac diseases. The majority of the inherited cardiac diseases causing sudden death express themselves at variable ages in the form of altered muscle function – for instance hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy – or in the form of arrhythmias, including Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome. Clinical and genetic research is continuously ongoing not only to identify those at risk but also to better define their level of risk. Deciding on the most appropriate clinical tests is a challenge in inherited diseases. It is in this situation that specialized clinical-genetic clinics have appeared to provide a complete assessment of patients and family members. The clinicians in the community, faced with a growing number of questions and doubts in the caring of these individuals, are increasingly using the expertise of these centers to address the clinical decisions in their patients. Clinical Approach to Sudden Cardiac Death Syndromes details the main guidelines to clinicians on how to approach the patients and family members with an inherited disease. It also includes an in-depth review of what is currently available to assist in the diagnosis, prevention and risk stratification in sudden cardiac death. This book is therefore an essential reference for all cardiologists and electrophysiologists, but also this will be important reading for general practice physicians who may be responsible for the identification of families at risk. 
137836;9781848003828;Multi-objective Management in Freight Logistics;The complexity of modern supply chains requires decision makers in logistics to work with a set of efficient (Pareto optimal) solutions, mainly to catch different economic aspects for which one optimal solution related to a single objective function is not able to capture entirely. Motivated by this, and by recent changes in global markets and the availability of new transportation services, Multi-objective Management in Freight Logistics provides a detailed study of freight transportation systems, with a specific focus on multi-objective modeling. Multi-objective Management in Freight Logistics provides decision makers with new methods and tools to implement multi-objective optimization models in logistics. The book combines theoretical aspects with applications, showing the advantages and the drawbacks of adopting scalarization techniques, and when it is worthwhile to reduce the problem to a goal programming one. The book also shows applications where more than one decision maker evaluates the effectiveness of the logistic system and thus a multilevel programming approach is sought to attain meaningful solutions. Multi-objective Management in Freight Logistics opens by presenting the general working framework, and with analyses of logistic platforms and intermodality management in large scale transportation systems. This is then followed by a study of multi-objective route planning, based on the application of hazardous material transportation. Additionally, the book examines freight distribution on a smaller scale, as in the case of goods distribution in metropolitan areas. The general approach followed by the text is that of presenting both the network design and the tactical (planning) point of view, providing mathematics, algorithms and related experiments for each problem.
174612;9781461430322;Mindfulness and Acceptance in Couple and Family Therapy;Mindfulness-based and acceptance-oriented therapies have become important treatment options for concerns as varied as depression, stress, and addictions, and are increasingly recognized as holding significant promise for addressing the complexity of relational issues. Especially as overwhelmed couples and overscheduled families struggle with issues of communication, trust, and forgiveness, mindfulness—the art of being in the moment and accepting without judgment—may hold powerful keys to healing.Mindfulness and Acceptance in Couple and Family Therapy offers professionals a practical, straightforward guide to how mindfulness works and why it is well-suited to many seemingly intractable relational problems. Introductory chapters review psychological and relational benefits of mindfulness, summarize its robust empirical base, and explain how being present can directly affect entrenched family issues and couples’ longstanding behavioral impasses. Case examples and sample exercises illustrate therapeutic mindfulness and acceptance in action. Mindfulness and acceptance are applied to all aspects of practice, including building a therapeutic relationship, case conceptualization, treatment planning, and intervention. In addition, Dr. Gehart provides numerous practice-ready resources, such as:Sample questions and assessment techniques for case conceptualization.Treatment plan templates for individuals, couples, and families.Handouts and web resources for teaching mindfulness in session. Detailed intervention instructions and handouts.As an evidence-informed therapeutic approach to difficult cases, or as a guide to more philosophical practice, Mindfulness and Acceptance in Couple and Family Therapy is an exciting new resource for couple and family practitioners, psychologists, social workers, and counselors.

The CD-ROM has been provided by Hermes Medical Solutions, Inc.
137843;9788847008281;Thymus Gland Pathology;The thymus has been a mysterious gland for centuries. The awareness of its role has been progressing, in particular during the second half of the twentieth century. The thymic pathology is related to several complex congenital, non-oncological, and oncological diseases. Many of these illnesses require a multidisciplinary approach thus involving several specialists: the surgeon, the neurologist, the anesthetist, and the pathologist. For example, myasthenia gravis—the most challenging disease deriving from a thymic trouble—requires an accurate and multimodal treatment. The oncologic pathology of the thymus is likewise complex, and involves also the oncologist and the radiotherapist. In cases of congenital thymic diseases, a transplantation of the thymus can be taken into consideration. This volume is an update on the pathology of this gland and includes 24 chapters written by international and well-known experts. The whole thymic pathology is described and new concepts about the nosological classification and the thymic neoplasm staging system are reported. Some chapters are focused on the radiologic, mini-invasive, and surgical diagnosis, and other chapters deal with surgical and non-surgical treatments. Special chapters are devoted to myasthenia gravis and thymus transplantation. The book will appeal to all the specialists involved in the treatment of thymic pathology, but can also be of interest to practitioners, and undergraduate and graduate students.

149893;9781848009257;The Respiratory Tract in Pediatric Critical Illness and Injury;The field of critical care medicine is in the midst of a dramatic change. Technological and scientific advances during the last decade have resulted in a fundamental change in the way we view disease processes, such as sepsis, shock, acute lung injury, and traumatic brain injury. Pediatric intensivists have been both witness to and active participants in bringing about these changes and it is imperative that all physicians caring for critically ill children in this new era have a thorough understanding of the applicability of these modern developments to the care of patients at the bedside and to keep up with the rapidly evolving field of critical care medicine. The respiratory system is unique in that it is constantly exposed to a barrage of foreign substances from both the internal and external environment. Many diseases affect the pediatric respiratory system, a large number of whom are not associated with acute respiratory failure. Nevertheless, these constitute a major portion of the practice of pediatric critical care medicine and can account for significant morbidity and mortality. The Respiratory Tract in Pediatric Critical Illness and Injury has been written by an international panel of experts to provide an in-depth review of respiratory disease in the critically ill or injured child. This book is therefore an ideal reference for all involved in the management of the pediatric critically ill patient, from physicians, residents and fellows in critical care, pulmonology, and cardiology, and pediatricians to specialist nurses and support personnel on the pediatric intensive care unit and all medical professionals who are involved in the management of these patients.
155352;9781447168959;Recent Advances in the 3D Physiological Human;Research into the 3D Physiological Human is a very active field focusing on the creation of patient-specific computer models for personalised healthcare.

115205;9780387281513;Modern Ferrite Technology;Modern Ferrite Technology, 2nd Ed. offers the readers an expert overview of the latest ferrite advances as well as their applications in electronic components. This volume develops the interplay among material properties, component specification and device requirements using ferrites. Throughout, emphasis is placed on practical technological concerns as opposed to mathematical and physical aspects of the subject.  The book traces the origin of the magnetic effect in ferrites from the level of the simplest particle and then increases the scope to include larger hierarchies. From the desired magnetic properties, the author deduces the physical and chemical material parameters, taking into consideration major chemistry, impurity levels, ceramic microstructures and grain boundary effects. He then discusses the processing conditions and associated conditions required for implementation. In addition to conventional ceramic techniques, he describes non-conventional methods such as co-precipitation, co-spray roasting and single crystal growth. Electronic materials research scientists and technicians, ferrite manufacturing and research engineers, electronic materials professors and students, electronic engineers in magnetic component design and high frequency power supply engineers will find this book to be an invaluable resource.

132406;9780387767666;Enclosed Experimental Ecosystems and Scale;The environmental challenges now facing humanity, ranging from climate change to urbanization to invasive species to agricultural and industrial pollutants are particularly acute in the coastal zone. Research in this region and in other aquatic ecosystems is complicated by interactions that occur over broad scales of time, space, and ecological complexity. Enclosed experimental ecosystems (mesocosms and microcosms) have become critical research tools because they provide a degree of control not achievable through field experiments. Yet to date, techniques for systematically extrapolating results from small-scale experimental ecosystems to larger, more open, more biodiverse, and more heterogeneous ecosystems in nature have not been well developed. This book is designed to provide scientists, resource managers and students with a comprehensive and practical guide and reference for improving the design and interpretation of research conducted in experimental ecosystems.
71403;9781846283475;Evolving Connectionist Systems;Evolving Connectionist Systems is aimed at all those interested in developing and using intelligent computational models and systems to solve challenging real world problems in computer science, engineering, bioinformatics and neuroinformatics. The book challenges scientists and practitioners with open questions about future creation of new information models inspired by Nature.   This second edition includes new methods for adaptive, knowledge-based learning, such as online incremental feature selection, spiking neural networks, transductive neuro-fuzzy inference, adaptive data and model integration, cellular automata and artificial life systems, particle swarm optimisation, ensembles of evolving systems, and quantum inspired neural networks.   New applications to gene and protein interaction modelling, brain data analysis and brain model creation, computational neuro-genetic modelling, adaptive speech, image and multimodal recognition, language modelling, adaptive robotics, modelling dynamic financial and socio-economic systems, and ecological modelling, are covered.   An important new feature of the book is the attempt to connect different structural and functional levels of a complex, intelligent system, looking for inspiration from functional relationships in natural systems, such as the genetic and the brain activity.  Overall, the book is more about problem solving and intelligent systems, than about mathematical proofs of theoretical models. Additional resources for practical model validation and system creation are attached as programs in the Appendix. Data, programs, colour figures and .ppt slides are available from: http://www.kedri.info/ and http://www.theneucom.com.

144122;9781402083945;Organizing Schools for Productive Learning;This book offers an alternative approach to secondary school organization. In line with the definition formulated by John Dewey's philosophy of education, the new approach aims to promote productive learning. The book shows the way to extricate schools from their past in order to respond more successfully to the requirements of the information age in which we are living today.  The chapters treat the primary components of teachers' work in schools in light of systems' theory as opposed to the organization of instruction prevalent in today's schools that is designed in light of bureaucratic theory. The book demonstrates how the current principles of organization impede the change and improvement of instruction and by necessity create boredom and the routinization of teachers' and students' activity in schools. 
156689;9789400796874;Bioremediation Technology;Environmental pollutants have become a major global concern. The modern growth of industrialization, urbanization, modern agricultural development and energy generation have resulted in indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources for fulfilling the human desires and needs, which have contributed in disturbing the ecological balance on which the quality of environment depends. The modern technological advancements in chemical processes/operations have been raised to new products and also new pollutants in abundant level which are above the self cleaning capacity of the environment. One of the major issues in present times is the threat to human lives, due to the progressive deterioration of the environment. This book discusses bioremediation technology-based remediation to restore contaminated sites and protect the environment. It studies the opportunities for more efficient biological processes in molecular biology and ecology.

135544;9789048178865;Pine Wilt Disease: A Worldwide Threat to Forest Ecosystems;The pinewood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the causal agent of pine wilt disease (PWD), is a serious pest and pathogen of forest tree species, in particular among the genus Pinus. It was first reported from Japan in the beginning of the XXth century, where it became the major ecological catastrophe of pine forests, with losses reaching over 2 million m3/ year in the 1980s. It has since then spread to other Asian countries such as China, Taiwan and Korea, causing serious losses and economic damage. In 1999, the PWN was first detected in the European Union (EU), in Portugal, and immmediately prompted several government (national and EU) actions to assess the extent of the nematode’s presence, and to contain B. xylophilus and its insect vector (Monochamus galloprovincialis) to an area with a 30km radius in the Setúbal Peninsula, 20 km south of Lisbon. International wood trade, with its political as well as economic ramifications, has been seriously jeopardized. The origin of the population of PWN found in Portugal remains elusive. Several hypotheses may be considered regarding pathway analysis, basically from two general origins: North America or the Far East (Japan or China). World trade of wood products such as timber, wooden crates, palettes, etc… play an important role in the potential dissemination of the pinewood nematode. In fact, human activities involving the movement of wood products may be considered the single most important factor in spreading of the PWN. Despite the dedicated and concerted actions of government agencies, this disease continues to spread. Very recently (2006), in Portugal, forestry and phytosanitary authorities (DGRF and DGPC) have announced a new strategy for the control and ultimately the erradication of the nematode, under the coordination of the national program for the control of the pinewood nematode (PROLUNP). Research regarding the bioecology of the nematode and insect as well as new detection methods, e.g., involving real-time PCR, has progressed since 1999. International agreements (GATT, WTO) and sharing of scientific information is of paramount importance to effectively control the nematode and its vector, and thus protect our forest ecosystems and forest economy.

132312;9781402062230;Positive Interactions and Interdependence in Plant Communities;Positive interactions and interdependence in plant communities offers a new look at an old problem – the nature of the communities. This book marshals ecological literature from the last century on facilitation to make the case against the widely accepted  individualistic  notion of community organization. Clearly, many species in many communities would not be present without the ameliorating effects of other species. In other words, communities are not produced only by summing the population ecology of species. Concepts covered include the idea that positive interactions are more prevalent in physically stressful conditions, species specificity in facilitative interactions, indirect facilitative interactions, how facilitation contributes to diversity-ecosystem function relationships, and potential evolutionary aspects of positive interactions. 
167395;9781402086892;Aerosol Pollution Impact on Precipitation;Life on Earth is critically dependent upon the continuous cycling of water between oceans, continents and the atmosphere. Precipitation (including rain, snow, and hail) is the primary mechanism for transporting water from the atmosphere back to the Earth's surface. It is also the key physical process that links aspects of climate, weather, and the global hydrological cycle. Changes in precipitation regimes and the frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, severe ice/snow storms, monsoon fluctuations and hurricanes are of great potential importance to life on the planet. One of the factors that could contribute to precipitation modification is aerosol pollution from various sources such as urban air pollution and biomass burning. Natural and anthropogenic changes in atmospheric aerosols might have important implications for precipitation by influencing the hydrological cycle, which in turn could feed back to climate changes.  From an Earth Science perspective, a key question is how changes expected in climate will translate into changes in the hydrological cycle, and what trends may be expected in the future. We require a much better understanding and hence predictive capability of the moisture and energy storages and exchanges among the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, continents and biological systems. This book is a review of our knowledge of the relationship between aerosols and precipitation reaching the Earth's surface and it includes a list of recommendations that could help to advance our knowledge in this area.

168759;9781447169215;Emerging Concepts in Neuro-Oncology;Neuro-oncology is one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving areas of oncology. In recent years there has been a remarkable increase in activity in the field, from basic science through to the clinic. This is reflected by advances in the understanding of the biology of CNS malignancies which have informed the development of novel and successful therapies.  In this environment it is essential to facilitate communication and understanding of new ideas and concepts. Emerging Concepts in Neuro-Oncology is written with this in mind: to encourage collaboration across traditional boundaries and promote translational research for patient benefit. The book moves from concepts in the scientific basis of neuro-oncology in part one, through models of brain cancer in part two, to emerging concepts in clinical practice in part three, with a focus on translational research. This book will be an essential read for neuroscience researchers, cancer researchers, neurosurgeons and clinical oncologists as well as anyone with an interest in this exciting, dynamic field.
103178;9789401039451;Observational Manifestation of Chaos in Astrophysical Objects;On August 2000 in the Lomonosov Moscow State University the first scientific conference dedicated to chaos in the real astronomical systems was held. The most prominent astrophysisists - specialist in the field of stochastic dynamics - attended the conference. A broad scope of the problems related to the observed manifes­ tations of chaotic motions in galactic and stellar objects, with the involvement of basic theory and numerical modeling, were addressed. The idea (not so obvious, as we believe, to many astrophysicists) was to show that, while great progress in the field of stochastic mechanics was accomplished, the science of chaos in actually observed systems is only just being born. Basically, the situation described prompted the organizers to hold the meeting in order to discuss chaotic processes in real systems. It seemed worthwhile to begin these introductory remarks with a brief descrip­ tion of some events that preceeded the conference. Since actually existing systems are the subject of the natural sciences, and in the latter experiments play the key role, we shall begin our account with the experimental results.
106242;9780306478352;Non-Coding RNAs;General inspection of a role performed in the cell by RNAs allows us to distinguish three major groups of transcripts: I. protein-coding mRNAs, II. non-coding housekeeping and III. regulatory RNAs.  The housekeeping RNAs include RNA classes that are generally, constitutively expressed and whose presence is required for normal function and viability of the cells. On the other hand, a group of regulatory RNAs includes RNA species that are expressed at certain stages of organism development or cell differentiation or as a response to external stimuli and can affect expression of other genes on the levels of transcription or translation.  Non-coding RNA transcripts form a heterogeneous class of RNAs that can not be characterized by a single specific function. Initially, the term non-coding RNA (ncRNA) was used primarily to describe polyadenylated and a capped eukaryotic RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II, but lacking long open reading frames. Now, this definition can be extended to cover all RNA transcripts that do not show protein-coding capacity and is sometimes used to describe any RNA that does not encode protein, including introns.  This book is an in-depth look at the function of Non-Coding RNAs and their relationship to Molecular Biology and Molecular Biology. 
95410;9780792355366;Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change for Bangladesh;Bangladesh faces many challenges. So long it has been mainly the traditional ones of socio­ economic development and eradication of poverty. Environment as a major factor in this process has only recently entered the scene. But even before environmental considerations in the development process has become the normal practice, the spectre of climate change has reared its ugly head. While Bangladesh is not unique among developing countries in being at the receiving end regarding the causes and consequences of climate change, both in the literal and allegorical sense of the term, the fact remains that it has made the prospects for sustainable socio-economic development in the country much more complex and formidable than before. Both for her own sake and the sake of the global community at large, therefore, Bangladesh has to initiate actions at various levels to face the challenge from now on. The present study is a part of that process. In 1996, the Governments of USA and Bangladesh together decided to initiate a comprehensive study on climate change in Bangladesh. A unique consortium of public and non-governmental research organisations with support from the relevant administrative arms of the Government carried out the study over 1996 and 1997. The report has been accepted by the Government and several of its recommendations are in the process of implementation. While the direction of climate change is broadly certain, its details leave much scope for speculation and interpretation.

62039;9783540657477;Ion Sources;Ion implantation has become a basic technology in device manufacturing. For efficient use of this accelerator-based technique the choice of appropriate ion sources is important. This book deals with the design and operation of ion sources. Additionally the physics of ion formation of the various elements with different charge states and charge neutralization are discussed. Ion selection and beam diagnostics are part of the book too. The presentation of the necessary equations and diagrams for the various parameters makes this book useful as a handbook for ion sources.
72090;9780387226439;Nonlocal Continuum Field Theories;Nonlocal continuum field theories are concerned with material bodies whose behavior at any interior point depends on the state of all other points in the body -- rather than only on an effective field resulting from these points -- in addition to its own state and the state of some calculable external field. Nonlocal field theory extends classical field theory by describing the responses of points within the medium by functionals rather than functions (the  constitutive relations  of classical field theory). Such considerations are already well known in solid-state physics, where the nonlocal interactions between the atoms are prevalent in determining the properties of the material. The tools developed for crystalline materials, however, do not lend themselves to analyzing amorphous materials, or materials in which imperfections are a major part of the structure. Nonlocal continuum theories, by contrast, can describe these materials faithfully at scales down to the lattice parameter. This book presents a unified approach to field theories for elastic solids, viscous fluids, and heat-conducting electromagnetic solids and fluids that include nonlocal effects in both space and time (memory effects). The solutions to the field equations agree remarkably well with atomic theories and experimental observations.

103990;9781441954251;Design of Energy-Efficient Application-Specific Instruction Set Processors;After a brief introduction to low-power VLSI design, the design space of ASIP instruction set architectures (ISAs) is introduced with a special focus on important features for digital signal processing. Based on the degrees of freedom offered by this design space, a consistent ASIP design flow is proposed: this design flow starts with a given application and uses incremental optimization of the ASIP hardware, of ASIP coprocessors and of the ASIP software by using a top-down approach and by applying application-specific modifications on all levels of design hierarchy. A broad range of real-world signal processing applications serves as vehicle to illustrate each design decision and provides a hands-on approach to ASIP design. Finally, two complete case studies demonstrate the feasibility and the efficiency of the proposed methodology and quantitatively evaluate the benefits of ASIPs in an industrial context.
103522;9781441954350;Prefrontal Cortex;This volume, Prefrontal Cortex: from Synaptic Plasticity to Cognition, is an interdisciplinary approach to characterize the function of the anterior portion of the frontal lobe in rodents and human and non-human primates. The specific topics discussed in the chapters of this volume are purposefully diverse: they range from membrane properties of prefrontal neurons to cognitive psychology. Nevertheless, this volume must not be regarded as a mere collection of writings with the different sub-themes. As you will see, chapters often vigorously encompass domains of the prefrontal field in effort to provide a big picture. That is actually what we attempted to do in this volume. On one hand, we have accumulated knowledge on the properties of neurons and synapses in the prefrontal cortex as well as the actions of critical neuromodulators such as dopamine. On the other hand, behavioral and cognitive neurosciences have begun to reveal the fascinating role of the prefrontal cortex in such mental processes as working memory, attention switching and rule following, and long-term memory. Needless to say, our ultimate goal as neurobiologists is to know what relationship there is between these cellular and cognitive processes. This volume is meant to serve as a comprehensive introduction towards that goal. Readers will be informed, for example, of how plasticity of prefrontal neurons is regulated, how it is involved in certain cognitive processes in rodents, and how the rodent models can apply to the primates.
102726;9781475764840;Scientific Computing, Validated Numerics, Interval Methods;Scan 2000, the GAMM - IMACS International Symposium on Scientific Computing, Computer Arithmetic, and Validated Numerics and Interval 2000, the International Conference on Interval Methods in Science and Engineering were jointly held in Karlsruhe, September 19-22, 2000. The joint conference continued the series of 7 previous Scan-symposia under the joint sponsorship of GAMM and IMACS. These conferences have traditionally covered the numerical and algorithmic aspects of scientific computing, with a strong emphasis on validation and verification of computed results as well as on arithmetic, programming, and algorithmic tools for this purpose. The conference further continued the series of 4 former Interval conferences focusing on interval methods and their application in science and engineering. The objectives are to propagate current applications and research as well as to promote a greater understanding and increased awareness of the subject matters. The symposium was held in Karlsruhe the European cradle of interval arithmetic and self-validating numerics and attracted 193 researchers from 33 countries. 12 invited and 153 contributed talks were given. But not only the quantity was overwhelming we were deeply impressed by the emerging maturity of our discipline. There were many talks discussing a wide variety of serious applications stretching all parts of mathematical modelling. New efficient, publicly available or even commercial tools were proposed or presented, and also foundations of the theory of intervals and reliable computations were considerably strengthened.

165798;9789400796713;Peace Through Commerce;The papers that comprise this book could hardly been conceived of 10 years ago. The idea of commercial republics having a positive impact on peaceful international relations was, of course, not new. Kant and Montesquieu argued for the idea and the idea that trade and peace might be linked has been standard political rhetoric in the west for decades. These were macro-level analyses of commerce and peace.  This remains a field in its infancy and this book provides a foundation for further in-depth analysis and inquiry.

91848;9781441950369;Personalist Economics;Personalist Economics: Moral Convictions, Economic Realities, and Social Action examines the nature of the worker and consumer from a personalist perspective, comparing that body of knowledge to what is received from conventional economics. A running theme throughout this book is that personalist economics is attentive to both aspects of human material need - physical need and the need for work as such - in a way that does not disregard human wants. Accordingly, this book is more concerned about the philosophical base and description of the economy's significant characteristics than social economic policy.  Personalist Economics explores four dimensions of particularly acute human physical need: unemployment, poverty, homelessness, and death. In addressing these four aspects of need, the book delves into the second and third domains of social economics: description of the significant characteristics of the economy, and social economic policy. In the same way, Personalist Economics explores two types of economic cooperation - supra-firm alliances and inter-firm partnerships - as means for addressing certain aspects of human material need. This book concludes with a lengthy discussion of the challenges facing personalist economics in the years ahead.
91615;9780792381686;Evolutionary Algorithms for VLSI CAD;In VLSI CAD, difficult optimization problems have to be solved on a constant basis. Various optimization techniques have been proposed in the past. While some of these methods have been shown to work well in applications and have become somewhat established over the years, other techniques have been ignored.  Recently, there has been a growing interest in optimization algorithms based on principles observed in nature, termed Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs).  Evolutionary Algorithms in VLSI CAD presents the basic concepts of EAs, and considers the application of EAs in VLSI CAD. It is the first book to show how EAs could be used to improve IC design tools and processes. Several successful applications from different areas of circuit design, like logic synthesis, mapping and testing, are described in detail.  Evolutionary Algorithms in VLSI CAD consists of two parts. The first part discusses basic principles of EAs and provides some easy-to-understand examples. Furthermore, a theoretical model for multi-objective optimization is presented. In the second part a software implementation of EAs is supplied together with detailed descriptions of several EA applications. These applications cover a wide range of VLSI CAD, and different methods for using EAs are described.  Evolutionary Algorithms in VLSI CAD is intended for CAD developers and researchers as well as those working in evolutionary algorithms and techniques supporting modern design tools and processes.
89115;9781441950543;Industrial Price, Quantity, and Productivity Indices;Industrial Price, Quantity, and Productivity Indices: The Micro-Economic Theory and an Application gives a comprehensive account of the micro-economic foundations of industrial price, quantity, and productivity indices. The various results available from the literature have been brought together into a consistent framework, based upon modern duality theory. This integration also made it possible to generalize several of these results. Thus, this book will be an important resource for theoretically as well as empirically-oriented researchers who seek to analyse economic problems with the help of index numbers.  Although this book's emphasis is on micro-economic theory, it is also intended as a practical guide. A full chapter is therefore devoted to an empirical application. Three different approaches are pursued: a straightforward empirical approach, a non-parametric estimation approach, and a parametric estimation approach. As well as illustrating some of the more important concepts explored in this book, and showing to what extent different computational approaches lead to different outcomes for the same measures, this chapter also makes a powerful case for the use of enterprise micro-data in economic research.
76383;9783642059018;Comprehensive Asymmetric Catalysis;The second supplement to the three volume reference work Comprehensive Asymmetric Catalysis critically reviews new developments to the hottest topics in the field written by recognised experts. Seven chapters which are already in the major reference work have been supplemented and additionally a new chapter on Aminohydroxylation of Carbon-Carbon Double Bonds has been included. Thus, the state of the art in this area is now re-established. Together with the basic three volume book set and Supplement 1 it is not only the principal reference source for synthetic organic chemists, but also for all scientific researchers who use chiral compounds in their work (for example, in biochemical investigations and molecular medicine) as well as for pharmaceutical chemists and other industrial researchers who prepare chiral compounds.

Because these patients often present with violence, confusion, suicidal attempts and bizarre behavior and thoughts, non-psychiatric physicians often react with various degrees of discomfort and avoidance. However, it is often important to make a decision whether the presenting symptoms are due to functional or organic illness since serious morbidity and mortality can occur in patients with acute organic brain disease. The differential diagnosis would include: Functional (Psychiatric) Disease Organic Disease Affective Disorders Delirium Schizophrenic Disorders Dementia Personality Disorders Anxiety Disorders Adjustment Disorders Findings which are helpful in raising the index of suspicion for organic disease are: a) Disorientation to time and place b) Fluctuating level of consciousness 1 EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRY/2 c) Age over 45 with no previous psychiatric history d) Abnormal autonomic signs (vital signs, pupillary responses, sweating) e) Acute onset of psychotic illness (hours to days) f) Ongoing medical disease and its treatment g) Recognition that hallucinations and delusions are frequently observed in organic as well as functional disease.

103623;9781402005084;Breeding For Ornamentals: Classical and Molecular Approaches;In this book we bring together the most up-to-date information on developments, both basic and applied, that already have or are expected to impact the field of ornamental breeding. These include classical and molecular techniques, traditional and high-throughput approaches and future trends. Since not only professional scientists, but also thousands of future scientists/students as well as amateur breeders around the world contribute heavily to the field of ornamental breeding, an introductory section dealing with the basics of molecular and classical genetics and the evolution of floral diversity is included. This should enable the reader to bridge the gap between traditional and molecular genetics. Classical approaches to the creation/selection of genetic variability, including mutation and tissue culture-aided breeding, are presented. Processes affecting ornamental and agronomic traits at the molecular level are delineated, along with an in-depth analysis of developments in the protection of intellectual property rights. The thoughts and strategies of molecular and classical geneticists, which are not always complementary or even compatible, are presented side by side in this book, and will serve to spark the imaginations of breeders as well as students entering the exciting world of state-of-the-art ornamentals.
32234;9783662040294;Sedimentary Basins;The modem geological sciences are characterized by extraordinarily rapid prog­ ress, as well as by the development and application of numerous new and refined methods, most of them handling an enormous amount of data available from all the continents and oceans. Given this state of affairs, it searns inevitable that rnany students and profes­ sionals tend to become experts in relatively narrow fields and thereby are in danger of losing a broad view of current knowledge. The abundance of new books and symposium volumes testifies to this trend toward specialization. However, many geologie processes are complex and result from the interaction of many, seemingly unrelated, individual factors. This signifies that we still need generalists who have the broad overview and are able to evaluate the great variety of factors and pro­ ces ses controlling a geologie system, such as a sedimentary basin. In addition, this also means that cooperation with other disciplines in the natural sciences and engi­ neering is increasingly important. Modem text books providing this broad overview of the earth sciences are rare.
169769;9780857295545;Children’s Upper and Lower Limb Fractures;Children’s Upper and Lower Limb Fractures has been written to give orthopaedic practitioners an easily accessible and concise description of upper and lower limb fractures encountered in the practice of pediatric orthopaedic surgery.  This book starts appropriately in considering the principles which should govern our care of the injured child and the background factors which influence fracture epidemiology. Knowing how to manage the multiply injured child and recognizing the one who has been non-accidentally injured are essential skills in our specialty. Injuries to the growth plate are not always easy to recognize and manage but, if we fail to do so, the long-term consequences may be serious. Succeeding chapters describe childhood injuries and fractures regionally. Conservative fracture management has not been forgotten amidst the plethora of newer methods of surgical fixation.      
174294;9783642430176;Inference for Diffusion Processes;Diffusion processes are a promising instrument for realistically modelling the time-continuous evolution of phenomena not only in the natural sciences but also in finance and economics. Their mathematical theory, however, is challenging, and hence diffusion modelling is often carried out incorrectly, and the according statistical inference is considered almost exclusively by theoreticians. This book explains both topics in an illustrative way which also addresses practitioners. It provides a complete overview of the current state of research and presents important, novel insights. The theory is demonstrated using real data applications.
172750;9781461410225;Psychosomatic Medicine;Psychosocial problems appear within a medical context worldwide, and are a major burden to health. Psychosomatic Medicine: An International Primer for the Primary Care Setting takes a uniquely global approach in laying the foundations of biopsychosocial basic care (such as recognizing psychosocial and psychosomatic problems, basic counseling, and collaboration with mental health specialists) and provides relevant information about the most common mental and psychosomatic problems and disorders. The scope of the book is intercultural—it addresses global cultures, subcultures living in a single country, and strengthening the care given by physicians working abroad. This clinically useful book outlines best practices for diagnosing the most common biopsychosocial problems and mastering the most common communication challenges (e.g. doctor-patient conversation, breaking bad news, dealing with difficult patients, family and health systems communication and collaboration). Every chapter integrates basic theoretical background and practical skills and includes trans-culturally sensitive material, important for work with patients from different cultures. Psychosomatic Medicine: An International Primer for the Primary Care Setting serves as an excellent resource for clinicians hoping to gain and develop knowledge and skills in psychosomatic medicine.
119923;9783211998816;Severe Attachment Disorder in Childhood;The important early bond between mother and baby is under stress. 3-5% of all children show signs of severe attachment problems, often leading to social problems and violent or criminal behavior and abuse later in life. Based on more than 20 years of theory and personal practice, this handbook of therapy provides a theoretical understanding of the topic, and a wealth of suggestions for daily practice.   The coverage includes a cross-scientific theoretical overview, the classic symptoms of disturbed attachment, and treatment at different stages of development, from measures to ensure a healthy attachment early in life to treatment at different stages of personality development to adulthood. For each step, many examples from daily practice as well as checklists at different stages are given. Special sections on adoption issues, how to teach the AD schoolchild, sexual abuse and AD give tools and inspiration for the reader's own research.   The final chapters address the personal development of the therapist as well as suggestions for designing the therapeutic milieu and teamwork. The book is equally useful to the practitioner and the adoptive parent

91886;9780792350446;The Dynamic Architecture of a Developing Organism;For anybody capable of an emotional response to it, any view of a developing organism should give birth to a feeling of amazement and even admiration, whether this development is seen directly, or in the form of a time lapse film, or even if mentally reconstructed from a series of static images. We ask ourselves how such seemingly primitive eggs or pieces of tissue, without any obvious intervention from outside, so regularly transform themselves into precisely constructed adult organisms. If we try to formulate what amazes us most of all about development, the answer will probably be that it is the internal capacity of developing organisms themselves to create new structures. How, then, can we satisfy our amazement in ways that are more or less reasonable, as well as scientifically valuable? This depends, first of all, on what position we choose to regard embryonic development as occupying among other structure creating processes, even including human activities. On the one hand, one might regard the development of organisms as a highly specialized class of processes, unique to themselves and alien to the general laws of nature, or at least not derivable from them and more akin to the deliberate acts of our own human behaviour. In that case our task would become reduced to a search for some specific 'instructions' for each next member of such a class. Whether in an overt or hidden form, some such ideology seems to dominate in present day developmental biology.
91728;9789048148837;Racism and the Law;Plessy v Ferguson (1897) established racial segregation in American constitutional law for over fifty years and its moral and political legacy lives on, despite attempts in the United States to counter its devastating effects during the last half century. Ironically, in the current debate over affirmative action, Justice Harlan's eloquent dissent has been used to justify attacks on government affirmative action programs. In this book, five distinguished philosophers and constitutional theorists, working from very different theoretical positions, take a fresh critical look at the moral and political principles underlying this historic decision and Harlan's dissent. They also explore the nature and extent of law's complicity in perpetuating Plessy's racialist aims. Emerging from their varied but complementary analyses is a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the social injustice of racial segregation in its historic and contemporary forms and of resources of the law to reverse it.

17685;9783642675829;Adaptability of Vascular Wall;The International Congresses of Angiology have had a 25-year tradition. Let us remember the 10 previous International Congresses, the first of which took place in Paris in 1952. On this occasion a stimulus for the foundation of the International Union,  Union Internationale d Angeiologie  came into existence. The period of 25 years is lon.qenough to evaluate the scientific progress which has been made in diagnosis, therapy and prevention of vascular diseases. Proceedings of the previous International Congresses of Angiology became attractive resources for scientific information in libraries all over the world. They represent really historic documents of remarkable development of angiology and wittness successful international cooperation in the settlement of serious medical problems of the twentieth century. The Proceedings of the XI. International Congress of Angiology held in Prague 1978 under the stimulating title  Adaptability of Vascular Wall  contains 284 original papers dealing with scientific and clinical research in arterial, venous and lymphatic circulation. The papers are incorporated into 12 chapters according to the main topics. In the first sections the questions of atherogenesis and thrombogenesis are discussed with regard to the adaptability of vascular wall in various metabolic, immunobiologic, and hemodynamic disorders. In the further sections attention is paid to new procedures in investigation, treatment, and prevention of arterial, venous, and lymphatic diseases. Peri­ pheral microangiopathies, renovascular hypertension, and coronary circulation represent another part.
20001;9783642732768;Antibiotics in the Tropics;International textbooks on infectious diseases and antibacterial chemotherapy are usually written for readers in North America and Europe. In many ways, they are not appropriate for the prob­ lems encountered in developing countries. This book, in contrast, intends to define the rules of antibacterial chemotherapy practised under conditions of limited resources. It is meant for everyone con­ cerned with the use of antibiotics in developing countries, includ­ ing doctors, medical assistants, pharmacists, officials in health mio­ isteries, and medical students. Throughout the book, treatment recommendations are made for 1 antibiotics from the WHO list of essential drugs. For example, em­ phasis has therefore been put upon chloramphenicol as a stable, unexpensive and widely available oral agent suitable for the treat­ ment of severe bacterial infections like septicemia and meningitis. So-called  international chemotherapy  with modem cephalospor­ ins and acylaminopenicillins has been outlined for comparison. Since it is the aim of the book to base treatment recommenda­ tions on data from developing countries, many data on the etiology of common bacterial infections in developing countries have also been included. Most of the data are from African, English-speak­ ing developing countries, but references have been made to the lit­ erature on South East Asia, India or Papua New Guinea, where appropriate. On the other hand, pertinent data were not available in every instance, so that several statements and recommendations had to be made as  best guess . The authors are aware of these imperfections and will welcome comments from the readers.
137590;9789048175963;Life in Extreme Environments;From the deepest seafloor to the highest mountain, from the hottest region to the cold Antarctic plateau, environments labeled as extreme are numerous on Earth and they present a wide variety of features and characteristics. The life processes occurring within these environments are equally diverse, not only depending on stress factors (e.g. temperature, pressure, pH and chemicals) but also on the type of life forms, ranging from microbes to higher species. How is life limited by and adapted to extreme external biotic and abiotic factors? This key question summarises the deliberations raised by this exciting and fascinating research area. Addressing the challenge of answering this question would help to reveal new insights and refine theories concerning the origin and evolution of life on our planet, as well as life beyond Earth. Investigating life processes under extreme conditions can also bring clues for understanding and predicting ecosystems' responses to global changes. Furthermore, this area of research has a wide application potential in the fields of (bio)technoloty, chemical industry, pharmaceutics, biomedicine or cosmetics.

137766;9789400790599;The Global Thermohaline Paleocirculation;Originally published in Russian in 2006, this is the first English translation of this important book on paleoceanography and paleoclimatology. Its initial publication was followed by a surge of interest in this subject prompting the author to revise and translate her original work. In the book, she successfully summarizes her own research over recent years and compiles an overview of up-to-date knowledge on past ocean circulation. The key topics include: - Modern thermohaline circulation and main stages of its development during the Cenozoic - Methods and proxies of paleoceanographic reconstruction - Variability of the meridional overturning circulation and paleoceanographic events in the North Atlantic during the last climatic cycle - Influence of the global thermohaline circulation on paleoceanographic events in the Eurasian Arctic seas, the Northern Indian Ocean, and the South China Sea - The role of the thermohaline circulation in global teleconnections in the Antarctic, Eurasian Arctic, northern Pacific and low latitudes Indo-Pacific.  Comprehensive investigation of hundreds of international publications and her own results, convinced the author that the global thermohaline circulation controls the remote teleconnections on millennial-scale and partly on centennial-scale, while short-term climate signals are mainly transferred by the atmosphere. This revised and extended English edition provides the latest unpublished data, new figures and modeling results. The extensive reference list contains more than 800 publications and 140 new references. Dr. Elena V. Ivanova is Senior Research Scientist and head of the Paleoceanography Team at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Shirshov Institute of Oceanology in Moscow. She is a member of the Russian Paleontological Society, The Micropaleontological Society, the American Geophysical Union, and was a Russian representative in IMAGES (the International Marine Global Change Study) from 1998 to 2007. In this book she reviews the data collected during 10 marine cruises including the IMAGES MONA cruise and a Russian-Norwegian cruise in the Barents Sea in 2004, where she served as a Chief Scientist.
143802;9781402069147;Profiling the European Citizen;In the eyes of many, one of the most challenging problems of the information society is that we are faced with an ever expanding mass of information. Selection of the relevant bits of information seems to become more important than the retrieval of data as such: the information is all out there, but what it means and how we should act on it may be one of the big questions of the 21st century. If an information society is a society with an exponential proliferation of data, a knowledge society must be the one that has learned how to cope with this.  Profiling technologies seem to be one of the most promising technological means to create order in the chaos of proliferating data. In this volume a multifocal view will be developed to focus upon what profiling is, where it is applied and what may be the impact on democracy and rule of law. Based on the work done within the European Network of Excellence (NoE) on the Future of Identity in Information Society (FIDIS), a set of authors from different disciplinary backgrounds and jurisdictions share their understanding of profiling as a technology that may be preconditional for the future of our information society.   
137780;9789048197439;Ecology Revisited;As concerns about humankind’s relationship with the environment move inexorably up the agenda, this volume tells the story of the history of the concept of ecology itself and adds much to the historical and philosophical debate over this multifaceted discipline. The text provides readers with an overview of the theoretical, institutional and historical formation of ecological knowledge. The varied local conditions of early ecology are considered in detail, while epistemological problems that lie on the borders of ecology, such as disunity and complexity, are discussed. The book traces the various phases of the history of the concept of ecology itself, from its 19th century origins and antecedents, through the emergence of the environmental movement in the later 20th century, to the future, and how ecology might be located in the environmental science framework of the 21st century.  The study of ‘ecological’ phenomena has never been confined solely to the work of researchers who consider themselves ecologists. It is rather a field of knowledge in which a plurality of practices, concepts and theories are developed. Thus, there exist numerous disciplinary subdivisions and research programmes within the field, the boundaries of which remain blurred. As a consequence, the deliberation to adequately identify the ecological field of knowledge, its epistemic and institutional setting, is still going on. This will be of central importance not only in locating ecology in the frame of 21st century environmental sciences but also for a better understanding of how nature and culture are intertwined in debates about pressing problems, such as climate change, the protection of species diversity, or the management of renewable resources.

172279;9780857299123;ECSCW 2011: Proceedings of the 12th European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 24-28 September 2011, Aarhus Denmark;This volume presents the proceedings of ECSCW 2011, the 12th European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work. Each conference offers an occasion to critically review our research field, which has been multidisciplinary and committed to high scientific standards, both theoretical and methodological, from its beginning. The papers this year focus on work and the enterprise as well as on the challenges of involving citizens, patients, etc. into collaborative settings. The papers embrace new theories, and discuss known ones. They contribute to the discussions on the blurring boundaries between home and work and on the ways we think about and study work. They introduce recent and emergent technologies, and study known social and collaborative technologies, such as wikis and video messages. Classical settings in computer supported cooperative work, e.g. meetings and standardization are also looked upon anew. With contributions from all over the world,  the papers in interesting ways help focus on the European perspective in our community. The 22  papers selected for this conference deal with and reflect the lively debate currently ongoing in our field of research. 
161335;9781447159582;Innovative Tools for Business Coalitions in B2B Applications;The manufacturing industry is facing the challenges of shifting its operations from the traditional factory integration philosophy to a supply chain based e-factory philosophy, and of transforming the focus of companies from the local factory to global enterprise and business. Innovative Tools for Business Coalitions in B2B Applications presents a set of innovative methodologies that can be used to face all the issues that stem from the interaction of customers and suppliers in an e-marketplace environment.The first methodology discussed is multi-agent architecture and this forms the basis of a simulation environment developed in order to test the proposed models. The second concerns a bargaining model based on the negotiation mechanism and the third centers on production planning to support agents during the bargaining phase. The fourth is the possibility of a coalition between the suppliers and the authors offer a choice of two different approaches. One is the application of Nash equilibrium to select the members of a potential coalition of sellers, while the other is a centralized approach with a profit sharing mechanism based on the Shapley value. All the innovative approaches reported in Innovative Tools for Business Coalitions in B2B Applications have been statistically tested in different market conditions.The methodologies, approaches and results presented in Innovative Tools for Business Coalitions in B2B Applications will be of interest to PhD students, operations managers and supply chain management researchers who develop value-added services for an e-marketplace in a business-to-business environment.
173006;9789400723665;Carbon Sequestration in Urban Ecosystems;Rapid urbanization started since early 1950s. Among numerous consequences of urbanization are change in landuse and land cover including deforestation, encroachment of prime farmland, and alterations in landscape. These consequences reduce the ecosystem carbon stocks especially in biota and soils, alter the hydrologic cycle by increasing runoff and decreasing soil water storage, change energy budget by altering albedo, and disrupt cycling of carbon and other elements. Such drastic alterations in land use and land cover and biogeochemical cycling of C and other elements affect global climate at local, regional and global scales because of drastic and irreversible changes in the structure, functions and dynamics of ecosystems. The global urban expansion rate is estimated at ~2 million ha (Mha) of additional land to accommodate annual population growth of 70 to 80 millions. Because urban areas consist of build up areas and green areas or free space, judicious management of free space is crucial to moderating the global carbon cycle. Open spaces can be sustainably managed for home lawns, sports grounds, recreational areas, forests, and urban agriculture. Green roofs are also important in influencing the albedo and the carbon and hydrologic cycles. The strategy is to increase the green space areas, enhance their net primary productivity, and increase the overall carbon budget of urban ecosystems. It is also important to link science with policy.
172685;9789400797031;Philosophical Faith and the Future of Humanity;Karl Jaspers, who died in 1969, had a profound impact on 20th-century theology and philosophy. His central thesis called for, among other things, a de-centering of philosophy from its Eurocentric roots and a renewal of its dialogue with other traditions, especially Asian ones. This collection of essays includes unpublished work by Jaspers himself as well as testimonies to his life and career by colleagues, associates, and translators, some of who knew Jaspers personally. Readers will also find commentary and interpretation by researchers who have explored Jaspers’ work for decades, and a biographical account of Jaspers’ student Leonard Ehrlich, who handled much of Jaspers’ English translation. The book interrogates Jaspers’ conceptions of ‘philosophical faith’, his philosophy of communication, and the prospects for world philosophy in the future. Focusing on philosophical faith, it assesses Jaspers’ interpretations of key philosophers such as Kant, Hegel, Schelling, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Rosenzweig, as well as examining his personal relationships with Bultmann and Heidegger. Contributors also look at Jaspers’ philosophies of religion and history, his hypothesis of the ‘axial age’ (Achsenzeit), and his contributions to metaphysics, periechontology, and economics. Finally, chapters cover Jaspers’ philosophy of communication and world history. The latter are informed by a burgeoning interest in Kantian ‘Freiheitphilosophie’ that influenced Jaspers, as well as concerns over the future of humanity. These concerns in part account for Jaspers’ growing popularity in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Central/South America, and Asia. Also included are lucid clarifications of the difference between religious and philosophical faith, and the relevance of certainty, trust, and communication for a future of mankind. Trained as a psychiatrist, Jaspers practiced this profession before becoming a philosopher and thus had a keen insight into the workings of the human mind even as he challenged the philosophical establishment of his time. It is perhaps this depth to his background that adds to the contemporary relevance of his work.
8042;9783642522062;Rheology of Polymers;If one dismisses the Prophetess Deborah who in her famous song after the victory over the Philistines sang  The mountains melted before the Lord  and her contemporary (on our time scale), the Egyptian Amenemhet, who designed the water clock, which was in fact the prototype of the capillary viscometer, the beginnings of modern rheology should be linked up with the works of the classics of natural sciences of the 19th century: J ames Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Ludwig Boltzmann, whose names are associated with the origination of the fundamental concepts of rheology. The founda­ tions of experimental rheology were also laid in the nineteenth century in the works of J. M. L. Poiseuille, T. Schwedoff, and others. The next step in the advancement of rheology dates back to the twenties of this century when E. C. Bingham, G. W. Scott-Blair, A. Nadai, and M. Reiner developed the fundamentals of the engineering approach to the technological properties of real materials, thereby outlining the numerous potential applications of rheology. The progress of polymer rheology was especially vigorous after World War II when polymeric materials found their way into industry and the home. Today, rheology is 60-70 per cent concerned with investigations of this kind of materials. Polymer rheology has evolved as an independent science over the last 10-15 years and is in its various aspects intimately entwined with molecular physics, continuum mechanics, and the processing of polymeric materials.
8148;9783642685026;Vessel Wall in Athero- and Thrombogenesis;Mankind in the second half of the twentieth century has encountered a number of social and economic problems, which, as never before, determine its future. Among the main problems facing medicine, meriting distinction is organization of the struggle against the increase of cardiovascular and oncological diseases which, with the birthrate, are the main demographic indices of our planet. According to the World Health-Organization, the deathrate from diseases of the cardiovascular system has risen by 60% in recent years, and there has been a sharp increase of myocardial infarctions and cases of sudden death in young people aged 25-30. The  geography  of heart and blood vessel diseases has changed: a dramatic increase of morbidity has been recorded in rural regions, and in districts where 10-20 years ago the native population was practically unaffected by atherosclerosis. Diseases of the cardiovascular system have become widespread among women as well as men. Cardiovascular diseases tax the national economy: they are responsible for over half the mortality among people at the prime of their productive life. More than 50% of temporary disability is also accounted for by ischemic heart disease, hypertension, stroke, etc.
972;9783540086895;Tables for Texture Analysis of Cubic Crystals;Recent progress in the material sciences has led to an increasing amount of interest in the role of textures for the behaviour of materials and in the mechanisms controlling the texture formation. This development was supported by a rather powerfull development taking place in the area of texture studies itself: Besides the usual, more qualitative, characterization of a texture by pole figures a fully quantitative description by a three-dimensional orientation distribution function (ODF) has been increasingly applied. There are two sides to the problem of quantitative representation of textures. One involves the mathematical technique associated with the acquisition of an ODF, and its transforms, from the experimental data, whereas the other concerns the methods of a rational description and interpretation of an ODF. The fust side can be considered from the practicaf point of view as experimental-data processing which is accomplished by a computer and is sort of a continuation of the measurement itself. Much attention has been paid to this problem, particulary by Bunge, who has written up achievements in this field in this extensive monograph /1/ and in conference proceedings /2/. There is also avaiable a rather detailed presen· tation of a system of subroutines written in Fortran /3/ which allows standard computations to be made without having to go into the mathematical details of the method.
8477;9783540101369;State of the Art of Surgery 1979/80;International surgical meetings with thousands of participants speaking a dozen different languages tend to be frustrating for the individual who comes with the hope of learning about progress in his fields, but who additionally would like to be able to ex­ change ideas on controversial topics and to meet competent people with whom to discuss specific problems. In the  one-way  ses­ sions in which long papers are presented, details or specific points may be missed. Differing views often are not adequately discussed, because the meeting and its participants are pressed for time. The 44 breakfast and luncheon sessions, covering different topics of interest to the practicing surgeon, were mainly planned to overcome these classical  congress handicaps  and also to do away with the anonymous atmosphere of such a large congress. Slides and formal papers were banished from these sessions. The outcome of these very lively and pleasant discussions taking place around small well-dressed tables was unexpected by most participants. A chairman and several panel members shared their repast, caloric and intellectual, with some 10-30 congress par­ ticipants. The result was in each instance a lively, informative intimate discussion, very different from the anonymous atmo­ sphere of a large meeting. In the hope of preserving these ex­ changes, the chairmen were requested immediately the session finished to  distill the essence  of the 90-minute exchange into a summary captured on tape.
26876;9783540514473;Computer-Based Management of Complex Systems;Especially during the last decade, the systems approach gained wide spread attention and increased influence in the world of academics and business. The holistic view of how individual elements interact with ea~h other to form an entity -not a collection of isolated parts -becomes more and more important. Whether it is called  integration  as in Computer Integrated Manufacturing,  organism  in ecological studies, or  network  like the communication network, it is the system's idea which opens neVI' dimensions for insights, applications and development. System Dynamics -or Industrial Dynamics as it was called during its early years by its founder and mentor, M.I.T.'s now Professor Emeritus Jay W. Forrester, -pioneered the use of system concepts and computer simulation for the analysis of complex problems in business and management. It was applied to study the dynamics of corporations, cities, national economies and, finally, the global problems of man and in his limited and fragile environment. The field has reached a stage of self sustained development and momentum. A few years ago the System Dynamics Society was founded, a high quality academic journal is now published in its fifth volume, and the annual International Conferences of the Society were institutionalized and took place in America, Europe and Asia. The organization of international meet· ings for this scientific community, however, is older than the System Dynamics Society itself. The first conventions were held as special sections of conferences devoted to simulation or cybernetics.
