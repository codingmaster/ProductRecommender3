(et al.)","","Computational complexity theory provides a framework for understanding the cost of solving computational problems, as measured by the requirement for resources such as time and space. The objects of study are algorithms defined within a formal model of computation. Upper bounds on the computational complexity of a problem are usually derived by constructing and analyzing specific algorithms. Meaningful lower bounds on computational complexity are harder to come by, and are not available for most problems of interest. The dominant approach in complexity theory is to consider algorithms as oper­ ating on finite strings of symbols from a finite alphabet.

The objects of study are algorithms defined within a formal model of computation. Upper bounds on the computational complexity of a problem are usually derived by constructing and analyzing specific algorithms. Meaningful lower bounds on computational complexity are harder to come by, and are not available for most problems of interest. The dominant approach in complexity theory is to consider algorithms as oper­ ating on finite strings of symbols from a finite alphabet. Such strings may represent various discrete objects such as integers or algebraic expressions, but cannot rep­ resent real or complex numbers, unless the numbers are rounded to approximate values from a discrete set.

In classical seismology, the Earth is modeled as a sequence of uniform horizontal layers (or spherical shells) having different elastic properties and one determines these properties from travel times and dispersion of seismic waves. The Earth, however, is not made of horizontally uniform layers, and classic seismic methods can take large-scale inhomogeneities into account. Smaller-scale irregularities, on the other hand, require other methods. Observations of continuous wave trains that follow classic direct S waves, known as coda waves, have shown that there are heterogeneities of random size scattered randomly throughout the layers of the classic seismic model. This book focuses on recent developments in the area of seismic wave propagation and scattering through the randomly heterogeneous structure of the Earth, with emphasis on the lithosphere. The presentation combines information from many sources to present a coherent introduction to the theory of scattering in acoustic and elastic materials and includes analyses of observations using the theoretical methods developed. The second edition especially includes new observational facts such as the spatial variation of medium inhomogeneities and the temporal change in scattering characteristics and recent theoretical developments in the envelope synthesis in random media for the last ten years. Mathematics is thoroughly rewritten for improving the readability.

It is divided into chapters which are largely independent, each one being devoted to a separate subject (graphics, differential equations, integration, polynomials, linear algebra, ... ), enabling each user to concentrate on the functions he really needs.

<P>""... Thus the book is designed for students, teachers, engineers and researchers aiming to master the Maple computer algebra system at an introductory level. The book achieves this aim. The coverage of material is quite extensive. ... I worked through selected parts of the book attempting to view the instructions from a beginner's perspective. The instructions are clear and the examples are relevant for most of the mathematics covered at undergraduate level by engineers and scientists. There are adequate warnings along the way as to where things might go wrong. This feature is a particularly useful aid to the beginner. I believe I would have found this book very helpful when I first started using Maple. ... The structure of the book allows the beginner to locate easily practical helpful information to deal with the problem at hand. ... ...I would recommend that some copies be placed in your computer laboratory to be on hand when students are working alone, as I am sure they will find it most helpful."" </P>

(et al.)","","One of the authors' stated goals for this publication is to ""modernize"" the course through the integration of Mathematica. Besides introducing students to the multivariable uses of Mathematica, and instructing them on how to use it as a tool in simplifying calculations, they also present intoductions to geometry, mathematical physics, and kinematics, topics of particular interest to engineering and physical science students. In using Mathematica as a tool, the authors take pains not to use it simply to define things as a whole bunch of new ""gadgets"" streamlined to the taste of the authors, but rather they exploit the tremendous resources built into the program. They also make it clear that Mathematica is not algorithms. At the same time, they clearly see the ways in which Mathematica can make things cleaner, clearer and simpler. The problem sets give students an opportunity to practice their newly learned skills, covering simple calculations with Mathematica, simple plots, a review of one-variable calculus using Mathematica for symbolic differentiation, integration and numberical integration. They also cover the practice of incorporating text and headings into a Mathematica notebook. A DOS-formatted diskette accompanies the printed work, containing both Mathematica 2.2 and 3.0 version notebooks, as well as sample examination problems for students. This supplementary work can be used with any standard multivariable calculus textbook. It is assumed that in most cases students will also have access to an introductory primer for Mathematica.","1507930104114","true",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"60177","174333466","1","57014",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3ec52b2836ba",,"One of the authors' stated goals for this publication is to ""modernize"" the course through the integration of Mathematica.

Publikationsorgan wurde das schon 1890 von Georg von Mayr herausgegebene Allgemeine Statistische Archiv. Nach Rückschlägen im 1. Weltkrieg wurde die Arbeit 1920 wieder aufgenommen. Nach dem Tod von Georg von May 1925, wurde Friedrich Zahn, Präsident des Bayerischen Statistischen Landesamtes und ebenfalls Professor in München, sein Nachfolger. Er war fachlich hoch renommiert und international angesehen. Von 1931 bis 1936 war er zugleich Präsident und danach Ehrenpräsident des Internationalen Statistischen Instituts. Eine Vielfalt volks- und betriebswirtschaftlicher Themen sowie Methodenfragen wurden in das Arbeitsfeld einbezogen. Das Verhältnis zur Mathematik blieb kritisch. Seit 1928 wird bis heute - zusammen mit dem Verband Deutscher Städtestatistiker – jährlich eine „Statistische Woche“ durchgeführt. Nach der Machtübernahme 1933 durch Adolf Hitler geriet die DStatG in das Fahrwasser nationalsozialistischer Politik. Politisch Missliebige und rassisch Verfolgte mussten die DStatG verlassen. Unter den Statistikern gab es von innerer Emigration über bereitwilliges Mitläufertum bis zu bewusster Täterschaft alle Abstufungen. Friedrich Zahn stellte sich fest auf den Boden der neuen Regierung. Im Rahmen der Wirtschaftsplanung wurden zukunftsträchtige Modelle entwickelt. Die wissenschaftliche Forschung blieb jedoch völlig abgeschottet vom Ausland. Nach dem Ende des 2. Weltkriegs wurde die amtliche Statistik in Westdeutschland bald wieder leistungsfähig. 1948 gründete der Präsident des Bayerischen Statistischen Landesamtes, Karl Wagner, unterstützt von Gerhard Fürst, dem späteren Präsidenten des Statistischen Bundesamtes, die DStatG neu. Ziel war es, die Zusammenarbeit aller Statistiker wieder zu beleben, an das internationale Niveau aufzuschließen und die Anwendung moderner Methoden in der Praxis zu fördern. Neue Ausschüsse wurden gegründet. Es folgten 24 Jahre fruchtbarer Arbeit unter Karl Wagner (1948-1960) und Gerhard Fürst (1960-1972). Zwar dominierten nach wie vor die Vertreter der amtlichen Statistik in der DStatG, aber die Zahl der Hochschullehrer nahm zu. Mit der Wahl Wolfgang Wetzels zum Vorsitzenden im Jahre 1972 begann eine 32jährige Ära, in der die praktische und die theoretische Statistik in einem ausgewogenen Verhältnis zueinander gepflegt wurden. Der Vorsitz wechselte alle vier Jahre. Die jährlichen Hauptversammlungen behandelten Themen wie Umweltschutz, soziale Sicherung, allgemeine Wirtschaftsfragen sowie Analysemethoden. Die Ausschüsse pflegten Ausbildungsfragen, Unternehmens-, Regional- und Preisstatistik, naturwissenschaftliche und technische Statistik, Ökonometrie sowie moderne Erhebungs- und Analysemethoden. Das Allgemeine Statistische Archiv wurde in eine englischsprachige und eine deutschsprachige Variante aufgeteilt. Die Diskussion um Volkszählung und registergestütztem Zensus sowie die deutsche Wiedervereinigung waren Anlass zu besonderem Engagement. Den neuen Herausforderungen der Globalisierung, der modernen Informationstechnologie und der Dynamik in den statistischen Wissenschaften stellt sich die DStatG durch eigene Initiativen und verstärkte Zusammenarbeit mit anderen Gesellschaften in der Deutschen Arbeitsgemeinschaft Statistik. Ein spezielles Ziel ist die Verbreitung des statistischen Wissens und seiner Erkenntnismöglichkeiten bereits in der Schule, aber auch generell in der Gesellschaft.",,,"1287612000000",,,,,,,,,

Meticulous biomicroscopic examination of macular changes and the essential value of fluorescein angiography for the detection of anatomical alterations of the macula and for precise evaluation of lesions and their course by indocyanine green angiography have naturally led the author Gabriel Coscas to analyze the new data provided by OCT.","<P>From the reviews:</P>

<P>""This excellent book on age-related macular degeneration is replete with high-resolution images of this complex retinal disease. … Ophthalmology residents and practitioners will benefit from this well organized text-atlas. … This is a very useful text-atlas for ophthalmologists learning to interpret OCT images of patients with age-related macular degeneration. The variety of images and depth of information distinguish this publication from OCT books that focus on a wider spectrum of macular diseases."" (Daniel V. Will, Doody’s Review Service, August, 2009)</P>

“This book provides a thorough demonstration of the use of different forms of imaging in the diagnosis and management of macular degeneration. … book certainly provides plenty of illustrations to give weight to this argument. … the main benefit of the book is the large number of illustrated cases which should provide a useful resource for photographers and clinicians both demonstrating the quality of photographs that can be obtained and aiding with their interpretation.” (James Talks, Eye News, February/March, 2010)<br />","PRC","Proceedings","false","false","false","Edition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://link.springer.com/978-3-642-01467-3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"- A wide range of fundus imaging modalities are now available, the respective values of each technique are explained ,

Karl Reinhard Aigner is Medical Director of the Department of Surgical Oncology in Medias Klinikum Burghausen, Bavaria. He had his surgical training in cardiovascular surgery at Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen. At Justus-Liebig University Giessen he specialized in surgical oncology, focusing on vascular techniques of drug delivery such as Implantofix and Jet Port catheters, and in 1981 first performed a technique of isolated perfusion of the liver with heart-lung machine in man. Furtheron he developed various techniques of segmental vascular isolation of body segments and organs, and the stopflow technique with adequately designed catheters. In 1982, together with Prof. Stephens from Sydney, he initiated the biannual International Congress of Regional Cancer Treatment (ICRCT) and from 1987 to 1991 was president of the International Society for Regional Cancer Therapy. From 1985 to 1998 he was managing editor of the International Journal Regional Cancer Treatment. He is author of numerous publications and book chapters, lectured and performed teaching operations on vascular perfusion techniques and oncological surgery in Europe the United States and Asia.</p><p>Frederick Oscar Stephens (MD, MS FRCS (Ed), FACS, FRACS) is former Professor of Surgical Oncology and Head of Department of Surgery, The University of Sydney, Australia. With other colleagues in Europe, UK, North America, South Africa, India, Japan and Tawain he has been a pioneer in the development of the principles of using integrated treatment modalities in management of locally advanced cancers. Advanced malignancies in limbs that previously required limb amputation can now be treated equally effectively without amputation in about 80% of patients. Oncologists in many cancer clinics worldwide are now achieving similarly improved results from the application of similar techniques and principles. He was the founding president of The International Society for Regional Cancer Therapy (1982) and has lectured extensively on regional cancer treatment and surgical oncology in Germany, Austria, France, England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, America, Canada, Israel, Greece, Hungary, Japan and New Zealand as well as in his home country of Australia. He is the author of over 200 publications in medical journals, several book Chapters and two theses. Since retirement he has authored 4 books on cancers in general and specific cancers for lay people, and with Professor Aigner and other world experts has written The Basics of Oncology, a text for medical and paramedical practitioners and nurse oncologists. A little known international surgical contribution of Professor Stephens is that when he was a Senior Surgical Registrar in training in Aberdeen Scotland with Professor Hugh Dudley, he published the first paper on Outpatient Surgery under general anaesthesia in adults in Lancet 1961. Outpatient (Day Stay or Ambulatory Surgery) techniques and policy have now become standard practice worldwide making great savings in health budgets the world over.</p>",,,"1301608800000",,,,,,,,"/978-3-319-28771-3",

(Eds.)","<P>This book is a comprehensive review of the rapidly advancing field of endovascular therapy, written by internationally recognized authorities in the field, many of whom are the innovators of the techniques and devices involved. Broad in scope, topics covered range from how to obtain training in approved endovascular techniques to promising new lines of investigational therapies. Reflecting the operative nature of many of the new endovascular therapies, this book is somewhat unique for an endovascular text in the strong representation of surgeons among its authors.</P>
<P>Purpose: The purpose is to train and update physicians with diverse levels of experience and from a variety of specialties in established, new, and still evolving endovascular techniques. Given the wide variation in expertise among different specialties interested in performing these procedures, and acknowledging that different specialties lack skill in different aspects of various procedures, a book such as this is badly needed. The goals are accomplished by providing broad overviews of the basics for those with little experience and in-depth presentations of advanced topics for more skilled physicians.</P>
<P>Audience: The audience includes vascular surgeons, who will take particular interest in the coverage of endovascular equipment and basic percutaneous techniques, and interventional cardiologists and radiologists, who have had little previous exposure to the operative aspects of endovascular therapy discussed in detail in this book.</P>
<P><EM>From the preface to the second edition:</EM></P>
<P><EM>Catheter-based diagnosis and treatment of vascular diseases has evolved over the last several decades, with a recent increase occurring in the utility of the therapeutic methods. This development has been stimulated by several factors including miniaturization of interventional devices and imaging technologies, and an emphasis on the utilization of minimally invasive, cost-effective treatments that reduce the economic impact of health care delivery. As part of this evolution, the development and adaptation of new interventional techniques and devices has produced a continual need for updating and training physicians in several subspecialties regarding the use of these methodologies. This requires not only adapting the technologies to current clinical practice but also establishing educational training curriculum in subspecialty fellowship programs.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Because endovascular technologies are of multispecialty interest, a review of the entire scope of fundamental information regarding each aspect of the field is required to furnish a comprehensive review that will provide specific utility for individuals from different disciplines. For this reason, we have undertaken the development of this text to satisfy two goals. The first is to provide a broad overview of the entire range of topics for clinicians with little or no background relevant to the subject matter. Secondly, those with some familiarity will find definitive informational material to allow adaptation of endovascular technologies to their current clinical practice.</EM></P>
<P><EM>To adequately understand and safely use catheter-based interventional therapies, knowledge of a number of topics beyond the clinical indications and techniques for applying endovascular methods is required. A thorough understand of the pathophysiology of vascular disease, safety issues regarding interventional devices and imaging methods, and a comprehension of fundamental biomaterials concepts is needed.

<P>""This book on Dynamics of Rockslides and Rockfalls is authored by Professor Theodor H.

The following detailed description of … rockslides, to end up with the Huascaran event in South America makes the reading of the book quite interesting as it is well written and illustrated with excellent photographs and carefully drawn diagrams."" (Giovanni Barla, Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering, Vol. 35 (2), 2002)</P>
<P>""As the title of this book indicates, its stress is on mechanisms, particularly the mechanisms of displacement. … the volume will be much used by professionals working at catastrophic rockslide prevention. The book … succeeds everywhere in making one think about rockslides and rockfalls and the dangers they present."" (M.

It originates in the study of geometry when we investigate the ratios of sides in similar right triangles, or when we look at the relationship between a chord of a circle and its arc. It leads to a much deeper study of periodic functions, and of the so-called transcendental functions, which cannot be described using finite algebraic processes. It also has many applications to physics, astronomy, and other branches of science. It is a very old subject. Many of the geometric results that we now state in trigonometric terms were given a purely geometric exposition by Euclid. Ptolemy, an early astronomer, began to go beyond Euclid, using the geometry of the time to construct what we now call tables of values of trigonometric functions. Trigonometry is an important introduction to calculus, where one stud­ ies what mathematicians call analytic properties of functions. One of the goals of this book is to prepare you for a course in calculus by directing your attention away from particular values of a function to a study of the function as an object in itself. This way of thinking is useful not just in calculus, but in many mathematical situations. So trigonometry is a part of pre-calculus, and is related to other pre-calculus topics, such as exponential and logarithmic functions, and complex numbers.","1507947843481","true",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"48779","174330697","1","44515",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"67f7401ca8f8",,"In a sense, trigonometry sits at the center of high school mathematics.

Ptolemy, an early astronomer, began to go beyond Euclid, using the geometry of the time to construct what we now call tables of values of trigonometric functions. Trigonometry is an important introduction to calculus, where one stud­ ies what mathematicians call analytic properties of functions. One of the goals of this book is to prepare you for a course in calculus by directing your attention away from particular values of a function to a study of the function as an object in itself. This way of thinking is useful not just in calculus, but in many mathematical situations. So trigonometry is a part of pre-calculus, and is related to other pre-calculus topics, such as exponential and logarithmic functions, and complex numbers.","<P>""Cover[s] all of the basic topics that a high school or beginning university student should be expected to know.... There are...some nice touches; for example, a nice informal discussion showing that the sine of an angle in a right triangle does not depend on whether the sides are measured in inches or centimeters...""</P>

<P>""Covers all the basics of the subject through beautiful illustrations and examples…. Throughout, the treatment stimulates the reader to think of mathematics as a unified subject."" </P>

<P>""As a teacher I enjoyed this book enormously and I will doubtless borrow many of the plums to spice up my lessons…. [For] that ideal student who is to be prepared to be challenged to think what the subject is really about, and has the patience to excavate the basic ideas for all they are worth before jumping on to the next chapter, it should prove to be a godsend."" </P>
<P><STRONG>—The Mathematical Gazette</STRONG></P>
<P>""The authors tried to explain the results of trigonometry as simply as possible…. The exercises include a few problems of each routine type. Most of the problems exhibit a new aspect of the technique or object under discussion. One of the goals of this book is to prepare students for a course in calculus. We recommend it for teachers and students."" </P>

The author elegantly manages to overcome dangers of an excessively dogmatic understanding of either position by giving the necessary attention to the cases whilst at the same time keeping the greater picture in view.

<P></P>
<P>""… Das Buch behandelt strategische, operative und wirtschaftliche Fragestellungen. ... Positiv konnte beim Lesen festgestellt werden, dass das Thema der Wirtschaftlichkeit eines PDM-Systems sehr ausführlich betrachtet und in den unterschiedlichsten Facetten dargestellt wird. ... Das Buch ist klar gegliedert und strukturiert; dies erleichtert dem Leser die Informationsaufnahme. Aufgrund des durch das Fallbeispiel hergestellten Praxisbezugs wird das Buch wohl eher einen Leser aus der Industrie als einen studentischen Leser ansprechen ... Es ist ein Buch für die Praxis.""

During this era, many national and international textbooks have been published in an attempt to educate not only the practitioners of our medical discipline, but also referring physicians and medical students. Some of the more recent large multic- tural texts, such as those by Ell and Ghambir, Sandler et al. and Henkin et al. , provide us with very comprehensive reference sources while some of the smaller texts totally writtenbytwo or threeindividuals,e. g. Mettler &Guiberteauand Ziessman,O’M- ley & Thrall, have achieved popularity with radiology residents and other physicians in training. The concept of Clinical Nuclear Medicine arose 3 years ago from a conversation between the editors, who have been close friends for many years. We have always felt that our relationship epitomizes one of the major strengths of nuclear medicine, which is the very close ties and spirit of educational cooperation that exist between international colleagues. We all share the same aim of doing whatever we can to op- mize patient care whether it be by introducing new pharmaceuticals and inst- ments or by developing new techniques or approaches to performing our broad spectrum of clinical procedures. Nuclear medicine physicians have almost uniformly been willing to share their expertise at national and international meetings. The - ternational nuclear medicine community, unlike many other larger specialty areas, has remained relatively small. It was within this spirit that Clinical Nuclear Medicine was born.","<P>From the reviews:</P>
<P></P>
<P>""Clinical Nuclear Medicine … focuses on the universal state of the art in both diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclide methodology. … This book is easily readable, with presentation of essential points and plentiful references, and the quality of the figures and tables is excellent. … is a useful guide to students, technologists, and practitioners in nuclear medicine and radiology, as well as to general physicians who request nuclear diagnosis or treatment. … will be a welcome contribution to the bookshelf of nuclear medicine or radiology clinics."" (E. Edmund Kim, Journal of Nuclear Medicine, Vol. 49 (6), 2008)</P>
<P>""Clinical Nuclear Medicine is a collaborative work that integrates the knowledge, excitement, and expertise of nuclear medicine professionals from around the world into a comprehensive and readable text for practitioners and trainees … .

<P></P>
<P>""The objective of this book is to describe the earth’s atmosphere and the earth-atmosphere system from a physical point of view. … the book is intended for undergraduate students pursuing courses in earth and atmospheric sciences. … The book will also prove to be useful to students and scientists who are working in other fields, because it provides excellent examples of the application of the fundamental laws of physics to an environment with which the reader is already very familiar."" (Fernande Grandjean and Gary J. Long, Belgian Physical Society Magazine, Issue (1), March, 2009)</P>
<P>""The Earth’s Atmosphere is a course resource for atmospheric science … . With the issue of global warming occupying political and public interest, this volume supplies the necessary foundation for students to understand the controlling factors and physics behind atmospheric processes. … Saha has done an excellent job developing a resource that will be useful not only to students in meterology, but also in geophysics, planetary science, and environmental science. … Summing Up: Highly recommended. Upper-division undergraduates and graduate students."" (S. A. Russell Gonzalez, Choice, Vol. 46 (8), April, 2009)</P>
<P>""The author tries to explain in the book some of the fundamental concepts and principles of the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere … . The book is primarily aimed at meeting the needs of students of undergraduate level pursuing courses in earth and atmospheric sciences, but could also be used as a reference book by graduate students as well as scientists working in other fields of science, desirous of learning more about the earth-atmosphere system.""

Realizing that this symposium was one of the few sources of condensed information on biologics, it became obvious that we had to create a means of informing an interested wider circle of scientists and especially general c- nicians. Therefore, the editors of this book suggested to the researchers at the symposium andalsotoprominent scientists andcliniciansinvolvedinthe developmentand application of biologics as their major field of interest the idea of assembling this compendium. We received an overwhelmingly positive response – thankfully also from the publisher – most being more than willing to support this innovative project with highly relevant chapters on the latest state of the art. As we were eager to fill the information gap with up-to-date knowledge, the project had to be finished within the shortest time possible. To all experienced with editing this was obviously a ch- lengeand we areverythankfultoall thecontributorsthatour timeline hadtobe extended by only a few months. This book represents a collection of the most recent knowledge on biologics written by people who have been active in the field for many years. Wolf-Henning Boehncke Heinfried H.

In general, it considers the intersection between copyright law and digital technologies. … The formula of the book is uncomplicated yet effective. … it is well sustained by a wide-ranging bibliography and reasonable index. ... is a worthy recommendation for law libraries. … it will interest students and academics involved with copyright law and technological developments. It will also be of great interest for copyright lawmakers in the European Union […]."" (Ghufran Sukkaryeh, European Intellectual Property Review, Vol. 30 (II), 2008)</p><p> ""[...] useful […] for anyone wanting to understand the workings and implications of the EU InfoSoc Directive, in effect Europe's DMCA. More important, Mazziotti points out that the InfoSoc Directive and the application of the 3-step test for exceptions have potentially gutted certain rights to make a private copy under the European private copying schema. Instead, he argues for more robust user-rights for both transformative and non-transformative uses. I support this conclusion."" (David Lametti, http://www.cipp.mcgill.ca/blog/category/entertainment-law/)</p><p>“The book is clearly written and thus provides well-structured argumentation. … Mazziotti makes recommendations on how the copyright law should be developed. … Mazziotti’s book offers an interesting approach to the European copyright debate.

Although it is not tied to any one language or library, it provides practical references to efficient open-source implementations of many of the algorithms and data structures; these should be the first refuge of the commercial developer. I can easily recommend this book as an intermediate undergraduate text, a refresher for those of us who only dimly remember our intermediate undergraduate courses, and as a reference for the professional development craftsman.""</i> Hal C.

Auflage:</p><p> </p><p>“... Die klare und prägnante Sprache der gesamten Kommentierung sowie die sehr gelungene Einführung in die komplexe Rechtsmaterie ermöglichen auch Neulingen eine rasche Orientierung ... Die Kommentierung ist insbesondere für Krankenhäuser und Ärzte, die klinische Prüfungen durchführen, eine wertvolle Arbeitshilfe ...“ (Dr. Florian Wölk, in: ZMGR Zeitschrift für das gesamte Medizin- und Gesundheitsrecht, 2013, Issue 2, S. 141 f.)</p><p><p><p><p> “... Das Sachregister ist gut, das Literaturverzeichnis beinhaltet nur die größeren Werke, was aber durch die Literaturangaben bei den jeweiligen Kommentierungen kompensiert wird. ... Zusammenfassend ist festzuhalten, dass der Kommentar gegenüber der Vorauflage gewonnen hat. Er ist insbesondere für den Einsteiger im Arzneimittelrecht geeignet. Aber auch für den ständig im Pharmarecht tätigen Juristen lohnt sich der ergänzende Blick in diesen Kommentar durchaus.“ (Dr. Christian Jäkel, in: Pharma Recht, Vol. 33, Issue 3, S. 85 f.)</p><p>“... Lippert aktualisiert tiefgreifend und anregend und erweitert seine Zuständigkeit mit einer erfreulich ausführlichen und gründlichen Bearbeitung der GCP-V. ... ist aktualisiert, in Literatur- und Rechtsprechungsverarbeitung, methodisch und argumentativ vor- bildlich sowie sachlich auf der Höhe der Zeit. ... ist insgesamt sowohl verwaltungsrechtlicht wie sicherheitsrechtlich und methodisch sehr kompetent und dogmatisch-argumentativ ausgezeichnet. Literatur und Rechtsprechung sind vorbildlich verarbeitet. ...erfüllt ... die selbstgesetzten Ziele. Vertiefungen sind ... wünschenswert. ... hat in den beiden letzten Auflagen an Prägnanz, Tiefe und Präzision erheblich gewonnen.“</p><p>“... erhält das Werk ... eine Kommentierung des Medizinprodukte ... wurden in bewährter Qualität ... Das Werk bietet über die aktuelle praxisbezogene Kommentierung des AMG ... Zusammenfassend ist festzuhalten, dass der Kommentar damit sowohl für Einsteiger in das Arzneimittelrecht als auch für langjährige Praktiker eine wertvolle Arbeitshilfe ist.“ (in: Phi Haftpflicht international, 2011, Issue 4)</p><p>“... Inhaltlich ist den Autoren eine geradlinige und gut verständliche Kommentierung gelungen. ... Positiv zu bewerten ist, dass der Kommentar … neben der ausführlichen Darstellung des Europäischen Zulassungsverfahrens auch einen Überblick über das bedeutsame US-Zulassungsverfahren bei der FDA enthält. ... Das Literaturverzeichnis weist die relevanten großen Werke auf und wird durch die Literaturangaben der jeweiligen Kommentierung ergänzt. Das Sachregister ist für die Recherche hilfreich. ... In den Fußnoten finden sich … auch Hinweise auf Websites mit weiteren Informationen. …“ (in: RPG Recht und Politik im Gesundheitswesen, 2011, Vol. 17, Issue 4, S. 69)</p><p><p>“... Der Deutsch/Lippert ist sowohl zur Einarbeitung für Einsteiger in den Medizinproduktebereich als auch für den täglichen Gebrauch der Insider als Orientierungshilfe sehr gut geeignet. In dem Klappentext des Buches wird darauf hingewiesen, dass es besonders geeignet ist, nach der Fachanwaltsverordnung für den Fachanwalt ‘Medizinrecht‘ die Grundzüge zu vermitteln; somit würde sich das Buch auch als Begleiter zur Vorbereitung auf den Kurs zum Fachanwalt ‘Medizinrecht‘ eignen ...“ (Gert H. Schorn, in: Medizinprodukte Journal, 2011, Vol. 18, Issue 4, S. 194)</p><p><p>""… Der Kommentar ist … eine umfassende Kommentierung. Diese enthält … eine Übersicht über das bedeutsame Zulassungsverfahren bei der FDA in den USA, … einen Überblick über die Grundzüge des Medizinproduktegesetzes … Zusätzlich beinhaltet der Kommentar Ausführungen zum Apothekengesetz. … Diese Neukommentierung des AMG muss eigentlich in jeder Klinik, die Arzneimittelforschung betreibt, einen Stammplatz in der Bibliothek haben. Aber auch Pharmaunternehmen sowie in der Arzneimittelbranche tätige Juristen sollten regelmäßig Zugriff zu diesem Kommentar haben.""(G.H.S., in: chirurgische praxis, 2007, Vol. 67, Issue 2, S. 322)</p><p>""Der Bedarf nach aktuellen Kommentaren zum deutschen Arzneimittelgesetz ist größer denn je. Umso erfreulicher ist es, dass nunmehr die zweite Auflage des von Deutsch und Lippen herausgegebenen AMG-Kommentars erschienen ist. … In formaler Hinsicht hat das Layout ein ‘Facelift‘ erfahren, was das Werk leserfreundlicher macht. … Inhaltlich haben die Verfasser die erste Auflage aktualisiert und um die Kommentierung der zwischenzeitlichen Gesetzesänderungen ergänzt. … Mit der zweiten Auflage hat dieser Kommentar seinen Platz im Gefüge der vorhandenen AMG-Kommentare verfestigt.""(RA Dr. jur. Dr. med. Adem Koyuncu, in: GesR - GesundheitsRecht, 2007, Issue 7, S. 336)</p><p>“… Insgesamt berücksichtigt die Kommentierung die Rechtsprechung und Literatur im Zeitpunkt der Drucklegung und ermöglicht durch viele Verweise eine genauere Erarbeitung der jeweiligen Rechtsprobleme. … ist der Kommentar in der dritten Auflage insgesamt eine sinnvolle und im Hinblick auf verschiedene Rechtsprobleme erhellende Ergänzung der sonstigen auf dem Markt befindlichen Kommentare zum Arzneimittelgesetz.“ (Dr. Ursel Paal/Taylor Wessing, in: StoffR Zeitschrift für Stoffrecht, 2011, Issue 6, S. 275)</p><p> “... bietet eine umfassende Übersicht über das Arzneimittelgesetz sowie Einführungen in weitere relevante Gesetze. … fanden insbesondere die AMG-Novelle von 2009, sowie zahlreiche weitere, v.a. europarechtlich bedingte Gesetzesänderungen Berücksichtigung. ... Inhaltlich ist den Autoren eine geradlinige und gut verständliche Kommentierung gelungen. Ferner sind alle relevanten Änderungen vom Kommentar umfasst und zumindest einführend, meist auch umfangreich erklärt. ... Das Literaturverzeichnis weist die relevanten großen Werke auf und wird durch die Literaturangaben der jeweiligen Kommentierung ergänzt ...“ (Prof. Dr. iur. Dr. med. Alexander P.F. Ehlers, in: RPG, 2011, Vol. 17, Issue 4, S. 69)</p><p>“... Die Kommentierung ist durchweg sehr kompetent. ... Durchgängig verwenden die Autoren eine klare, auch für den juristischen Laien verständliche Sprache. ... Der Kommentar zum Arzneimittelgesetz von Deutsch und Lippen ist für jeden Juristen zu empfehlen, der Fragen des Arzneimittelrechts bearbeitet. Wer als Arzt in einer Klinik oder als Mitarbeiter eines pharmazeutischen Unternehmens etwa mit Fragen der klinischen Prüfungen oder anderen Fragen des Arzneimittelrechtes befasst ist, wird den praxisorientierten und gut lesbaren Kommentar als Einführung in die Materie ebenfalls zu schätzen wissen.“ (RA Jürgen Fiegler, in: GesundheitsRecht GesR, 20/February/2012, Issue: 2, S. 126)</p><p><br />","MGR","Monograph","false","false","false","Edition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://link.springer.com/978-3-642-01455-0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Praxisbezogene Kommentierung des AMG,Komprimierter Überblick über des Heilmittelwerbegesets, das Medizineproduktegesetz und das Transfusionsgesetz",,,,,,,,,,,,,

<LI>Mit zahlreichen Fallbeispielen aus der Beratungspraxis und Cartoons</LI></UL>","<P>""'Gender Mainstreaming' ist ein übersichtlich gestaltetes, sehr praxisbezogenes Buch, das Grundlagen vermittelt, Gleichstellungsziele und -standards definiert sowie die Handlungsfelder und Rollen der Führungskräfte thematisiert. Die langjährige Erfahrung der Autorinnen in der Beratung von Unternehmen, Regierungen, Verwaltungen und Organisationen zeigt sich nicht zuletzt im vielfältigen Angebot an Werkzeugen, die sich in zahlreichen Situationen einsetzen lassen. Die vielen Fallbeispiele verdeutlichen die Verbesserungsvorschläge. Mit diesem Buch ist es Doblhofer und Küng gelungen, die GEM-Strategie verständlich und praxisnah zu erklären. Das Praxisbuch richtet sich bewusst an eine weit gefasste Zielgruppe und ist nicht nur hilfreich, sondern auch sorgfältig formuliert. [...] Das Glossar und die weiterführenden Literaturangaben sind ebenfalls ein Pluspunkt.""</P>

<P>""Es gibt nur eine Empfehlung für dieses Praxisbuch, das 100%ig anwendungsorientiert ist: Unbedingt erwerben! Zum einen bietet es kurz und bündig Einblick in die Entstehung von Gender Mainstreaming und dessen Umsetzung. Zum anderen liefert es eine Fülle an anschaulichen Beispielen und vielfältigen Managementtools sowie direkt anwendbare Arbeitsblätter. Es ist lesefreundlich geschrieben und übersichtlich gestaltet mit Querverweisen, so dass schnell die wichtigen Informationen gefunden werden.""</P>

The facts are simple enough: the need for therapy outstrips the supply of quality therapists. Not everyone who needs help has the time or money for treatment, or has access to a qualified practitioner. And in many cases, traditional therapy may not be appropriate or necessary.

Enter stepped care, which offers a range of interventions so clients can choose the most applicable, efficient and least intrusive methods, from  educational information to self-help materials, from adjunctive treatment with minimal clinician involvement to traditional in-office therapy. Stepped Care and E-Health sets out a workable client-centered model that capitalizes on the availability and immediacy of innovative internet resources (e.g., web sites and e-books) so that individuals can receive quality care, in the most time- and cost-efficient manner, to match their stage of need and to give them choice. Chapters follow an easy-access format, with a brief discussion of each problem and details of an evidence-informed stepped care approach: description of each step, triage and assessment methods, online resources, and references. A wide range of clinical conditions is featured, including:   

•	Mood disorders.
•	Substance abuse.
•	Phobias.
•	Obesity and eating disorders.
•	Pediatric behavior problems.
•	Sexual disorders and dysfunctions.
•	PTSD.

Edited by Antony Morgan, Maggie Davies, and Erio Ziglio


As global health inequities continue to widen, policymakers are redoubling their efforts to address them. Yet the effectiveness and quality of these programs vary considerably, sometimes resulting in the reverse of expected outcomes. While local political issues or cultural conflicts may play a part in these situations, an important new book points to a universal factor: the prevailing deficit model of assessing health needs, which puts disadvantaged communities on the defensive while ignoring their potential strengths.

The asset model proposed in Health Assets in a Global Context offers a necessary complement to the problem-focused framework by assessing multiple levels of health-promoting aspects in populations, and promoting joint solutions between communities and outside agencies. The book provides not only rationales and methodologies (e.g., measuring resilience and similar elusive qualities) but also concrete examples of asset-based initiatives in use across the world on the individual and community levels, including:

•	Strengthening the assets of disadvantaged women (Germany).
•	Sustainable community-based development programs (India).
•	Using parental assets to control child malaria (West Africa).
•	Asset/evidence-based health promotion in the schools (Romania).
•	Evaluating asset-based programs (Latin America).
•	Using social capital to promote health equity (Australia).

Since then, environmental regulation has proved detrimental to both industrial and environmental performance. It contributed to a deepening confrontation between environmental and industrial groups, a rift which spread to other areas of politics and society. This book traces the origin of the current conflict and carefully analyzes current environmental and resource policy. Other advanced nations, especially in the EU, evolved more sophisticated and cooperative policies. These have led to high environmental quality and have permitted the EU to lead in global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the environmental regulatory policies have fostered robust industrial and fiscal performance. Americans know something has gone wrong in the U.S. The book's candid comparison of U.S. and EU policies yields fresh perspectives on sources of U.S. dilemmas in energy policy, Congressional lawmaking, and other areas of concern.</P>
<P>""Managing the environment has become an issue of such bitter partisanship in the U.S. that the prospects for further progress may seem bleak. Frank Manheim's detailed, even-handed, and historically grounded analysis offers a generous counterpoint to today's rancorous environmental politics. His book challenges Americans to look beyond domestic gridlock, and regain perspective by taking advantage of EU experience and building a sense of mission around the interlocking goals of climate stabilization, energy independence, and economic vitality.""</P>

Design considerations for low-power operations and robustness with respect to variations typically impose contradictory requirements. Low-power design techniques such as voltage scaling, dual-threshold assignment and gate sizing can have large negative impact on parametric yield under process variations. This book focuses on circuit/architectural design techniques for achieving low power operation under parameter variations. Coverage includes logic and memory design, modeling and analysis, as well as design methodology to achieve simultaneously low power and variation tolerance, while minimizing design overhead.  

•Introduces readers to some of the most important challenges in low-power and variation-tolerant IC design in nanoscale technologies; 
•Presents a holistic view of Low-Power Variation-Tolerant Design, at different levels of design abstraction, starting from device to circuit, architecture and system;

Design considerations for low-power operations and robustness with respect to variations typically impose contradictory requirements. Low-power design techniques such as voltage scaling, dual-threshold assignment and gate sizing can have large negative impact on parametric yield under process variations. This book focuses on circuit/architectural design techniques for achieving low power operation under parameter variations. Coverage includes logic and memory design, modeling and analysis, as well as design methodology to achieve simultaneously low power and variation tolerance, while minimizing design overhead.  

•Introduces readers to some of the most important challenges in low-power and variation-tolerant IC design in nanoscale technologies; 
•Presents a holistic view of Low-Power Variation-Tolerant Design, at different levels of design abstraction, starting from device to circuit, architecture and system;
•Offers comprehensive coverage of modeling, analysis and design methodology for low power and variation-tolerant logic circuits, memory and systems, micro-architecture, DSP, mixed-signal and FPGAs, including current industrial practices, technology scaling trends, and emerging challenges;

The Massachusetts General Hospital Radiation Oncology Department, staff, residents and fellows, past and present, concur that MGH stands for Man’s Greatest Hospital. This decidedly immodest assessment is widely viewed amongst the group as being manifestly true, and that perception is clearly reflected in a marvelous esprit de corp. Such an unequivocally positive attitude is solidly based on the judgment that the best possible care is provided to each MGH patient, i.e. the patient is, in fact, Number One. There is a deep sense of pride in the contributions made by this department to the scientific advancement of oncology, with an objective to continue progressively and substantially increasing the proportion of patients who are free of tumor and of treatment related morbidity.  

Evolution of Radiation of Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital is the work of the former Chair of the Department, Herman D. Suit, with his successor, Jay S. Loeffler.  From 1970 – 2000, Dr. Suit’s guidance and management of this Department brought it to recognition as a world class center.  Dr. Suit was key in developing and building the Department that now includes The Northeast Proton Therapy Center at the MGH.  His passion for the science of radiation therapy and its evolution through the years is evident in this book.   Dr. Loeffler is a pioneer in the development and application of novel radiation delivery technologies and the use of biologics to enhance radiation effect for patients with brain tumors.  Dr. Suit and Dr. Loeffler continue their close collaboration at MGH.
