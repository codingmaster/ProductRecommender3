          "description": "Many-valued logics are becoming increasingly important in many branches of science. This is the second volume of a comprehensive two-volume handbook on many-valued logics by two leading members of the famous Polish school of logic. While the first volume was mainly concerned with theoretical foundations, this volume emphasizes automated reasoning, practical applications, and latest developments in closely related fields, such as fuzzy logics and rough set theory. It offers an extensive overview of Gentzen deduction systems and multi-sequential systems in many-valued logics and shows the application of the resolution principle to such logics. It discusses applications in such areas as software specification and electronic circuit verification and presents fuzzy logics and rough set theory in detail.",

          "description": "The maturation phenomenon refers to postischemic changes that develop hours or days following an ischemic insult. The delayed neuronal death of CA1 pyramidical cells of the hippocampus is a classic example. The report of the phenomenon has boosted research in this field, as it became evident that ischemic damage is not a sudden event but a process potentially susceptible to therapeutic intervention. In September 1990, the first international symposium on \"Maturation Phenomenon in Cerebral Ischemia\" was held in Tokyo. The second symposium was organized in Tokyo in March/April 1996. Since then, new developments have rapidly delivered information about the molecular nature and dynamics of mechanisms concerning cell death and recovery. This book contains the presentations of the 3rd international symposium held in Pozilly/Italy in April 1998. It outlines the present status of the investigation and provides further stimulation for research in this field.",

          "description": "Seismic waves - generated both by natural earthquakes and by man-made sources - have produced an enormous amount of information about the Earth's interior. In classical seismology, the Earth is modeled as a sequence of uniform horizontal layers (or spherical shells) having different elastic properties and one determines these properties from travel times and dispersion of seismic waves. The Earth, however, is not made of horizontally uniform layers, and classic seismic methods can take large-scale inhomogeneities into account. Smaller-scale irregularities, on the other hand, require other methods. Observations of continuous wave trains that follow classic direct S waves, known as coda waves, have shown that there are heterogeneities of random size scattered randomly throughout the layers of the classic seismic model. This book focuses on recent developments in the area of seismic wave propagation and scattering through the randomly heterogeneous structure of the Earth, with emphasis on the lithosphere. The presentation combines information from many sources to present a coherent introduction to the theory of scattering in acoustic and elastic materials and includes analyses of observations using the theoretical methods developed. The second edition especially includes new observational facts such as the spatial variation of medium inhomogeneities and the temporal change in scattering characteristics and recent theoretical developments in the envelope synthesis in random media for the last ten years. Mathematics is thoroughly rewritten for improving the readability. Written for advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students of geophysics or planetary sciences, this book should also be of interest to civil engineers, seismologists, acoustical engineers, and others interested in wave propagation through inhomogeneous elastic media.",

It is organized according to anatomo-surgical pathways to the hidden areas of the skull base. These pathways are described in step-by-step fashion with the aid of a wealth of color images and illustrations. The emphasis is on endoscopic anatomy, but in order to provide a holistic perspective, informative three-dimensional reconstructions are presented alongside the endoscopic images and radiologic images are included when appropriate. In effect, windows are opened on the anatomy so that the reader is guided on a journey throughout the skull base region. This anatomically oriented atlas will serve as an ideal learning tool for novice surgeons and will also prove an invaluable reference for the more experienced surgeon.",

          "description": "Integral, or structural, foams are one of the most remarkable materials that have been developed over the last fifteen years. As with all rapidly growing fields, the terminology seems to have grown even faster. Thus there are two names for the material structure itself. In the United States and in Japan the term for these plastics is Structural Foams, whereas in Europe and the USSR the term used is usually Integral Foams. We have adhered to the European term in the text and hope our colleagues will bear with us. Integral foams have a specific structure: a cellular core that gradually turns into a solid skin. The skin gives the part its form and stiffness, while the cellular core contributes to the very high strength-to-weight values of the material. These are higher than those of some unfoamed plastics and metals. The sandwich-like structure with its unique mechanical properties was prompted by nature. Wood and bone are strong and light-weight natural materials having a cellular structure. Since the sandwich-like structure of the integral foams resembles that of natural wood, the foams are often referred to as artifical wood or plastic wood, thereby emphasizing not only the formal structural similarity of these materials, but also one of the main functional applications of integral foams - replacement of wooden articles in various fields of engineering and construction.",

In many countries, it accounts for more than 70% of gross domestic product, and approximately the same percentage of all employees work in this sector. To reflect the economic relevance of the service sector, services science must be established as an academic discipline. But the path in pursuit of this goal is riddled with challenges, especially in the fields of services research, service-oriented education and service-related collaborations. This book includes detailed articles and short statements on each field, written by academics and experts. They explain which challenges need to be met by research and academic training in the services community of the 21st century. The contributions contained in this book reflect the content of presentations and statements given at the first German Services Science Conference.</P>",

Frequently, however, teams are relatively unaware of the work being undertaken in other institutions, and this situation may slow further progress. This book aims to present the full range of management techniques and practices used in induction chemotherapy within one accessible volume. It provides up-to-date information on the pioneering and cutting edge practices employed in different institutions and documents the advantages of integrated treatment schedules. Patient selection is discussed, and each of the cancer types for which induction therapy has proved important is considered in detail. All who are responsible for the treatment of patients with locally advanced cancers will find this book to be an invaluable source of information. It will be particularly interesting for specialist oncologists aiming to set up and develop fully comprehensive cancer centres and for health administrators wishing to learn about the benefits of establishing such centres in strategic locations.",

Nevertheless, when faced with a real-world problem, it is still very hard to decide which of these different approaches to use.</p><p>In this book, the editors present an overall overview and comparison of the main current evaluation initiatives for SWS. The presentation is divided into four parts, each referring to one of the evaluation initiatives. Part I covers the long-established first two tracks of the Semantic Service Selection (S3) Contest – the OWL-S matchmaker evaluation and the SAWSDL matchmaker evaluation. Part II introduces the new S3 Jena Geography Dataset (JGD) cross evaluation contest. Part III presents the Semantic Web Service Challenge. Lastly, Part IV reports on the semantic aspects of the Web Service Challenge. The introduction to each part provides an overview of the evaluation initiative and overall results for its latest evaluation workshops. The following chapters in each part, written by the participants, detail their approaches, solutions and lessons learned.</p>This book is aimed at two different types of readers. Researchers on SWS technology receive an overview of existing approaches in SWS with a particular focus on evaluation approaches; potential users of SWS technologies receive a comprehensive summary of the respective strengths and weaknesses of current systems and thus guidance on factors that play a role in evaluation.",

          "description": "<P>This book is a comprehensive review of the rapidly advancing field of endovascular therapy, written by internationally recognized authorities in the field, many of whom are the innovators of the techniques and devices involved. Broad in scope, topics covered range from how to obtain training in approved endovascular techniques to promising new lines of investigational therapies. Reflecting the operative nature of many of the new endovascular therapies, this book is somewhat unique for an endovascular text in the strong representation of surgeons among its authors.</P>\n<P>Purpose: The purpose is to train and update physicians with diverse levels of experience and from a variety of specialties in established, new, and still evolving endovascular techniques. Given the wide variation in expertise among different specialties interested in performing these procedures, and acknowledging that different specialties lack skill in different aspects of various procedures, a book such as this is badly needed. The goals are accomplished by providing broad overviews of the basics for those with little experience and in-depth presentations of advanced topics for more skilled physicians.</P>\n<P>Audience: The audience includes vascular surgeons, who will take particular interest in the coverage of endovascular equipment and basic percutaneous techniques, and interventional cardiologists and radiologists, who have had little previous exposure to the operative aspects of endovascular therapy discussed in detail in this book.</P>\n<P><EM>From the preface to the second edition:</EM></P>\n<P><EM>Catheter-based diagnosis and treatment of vascular diseases has evolved over the last several decades, with a recent increase occurring in the utility of the therapeutic methods. This development has been stimulated by several factors including miniaturization of interventional devices and imaging technologies, and an emphasis on the utilization of minimally invasive, cost-effective treatments that reduce the economic impact of health care delivery. As part of this evolution, the development and adaptation of new interventional techniques and devices has produced a continual need for updating and training physicians in several subspecialties regarding the use of these methodologies. This requires not only adapting the technologies to current clinical practice but also establishing educational training curriculum in subspecialty fellowship programs.</EM></P>\n<P><EM>Because endovascular technologies are of multispecialty interest, a review of the entire scope of fundamental information regarding each aspect of the field is required to furnish a comprehensive review that will provide specific utility for individuals from different disciplines. For this reason, we have undertaken the development of this text to satisfy two goals. The first is to provide a broad overview of the entire range of topics for clinicians with little or no background relevant to the subject matter. Secondly, those with some familiarity will find definitive informational material to allow adaptation of endovascular technologies to their current clinical practice.</EM></P>\n<P><EM>To adequately understand and safely use catheter-based interventional therapies, knowledge of a number of topics beyond the clinical indications and techniques for applying endovascular methods is required. A thorough understand of the pathophysiology of vascular disease, safety issues regarding interventional devices and imaging methods, and a comprehension of fundamental biomaterials concepts is needed. These topics are addressed in detail and represent relatively mature aspects of this field that are otherwise characterized by continual change in devices and techniques as the field expands.</EM></P>",

They are described in the framework of the subsystems where they function and in accordance with the flight mission they are designed to serve. The book is intended for students at the advanced undergraduate or graduate level and for research engineers who need to acquire this kind of knowledge. An effort has been made to explain, within a uniform framework of mathematical modeling, the physics upon which a certain sensor concept is based, its construction, its dynamics, and its error sources and their corresponding mathematical models. Equipped with such knowledge and understanding, the student or research engineer should be able to get involved in research and development activities of guidance, control, and navigation systems and to contribute to the initiation of novel ideas in the aerospace sensor field. As a designer and systems engineer, he should be able to correctly interpret the various items in a technical data list and thus to interact intelligently with manufacturers' representatives and other members of an R&D team. Much of the text has evolved from undergraduate and graduate courses given by the author during the past seventeen years at the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Technion- Israel Institute of Technology and from his earlier research and development experience in flight control, guidance, navigation, and avionics at the Ministry of Defense Central Research Institute.",

This volume reflects the search for a better understanding of landscapes and landforms in igneous and metamorphic terrains at different latitudes. Furthermore, it covers a wide field of investigation gathered on four continents and addresses the issue at a wide range of spatial and timescales. It is an ideal volume not only for post-graduate geomorphology students but also for geoscience scholars concerned with igneous petrology, quaternary geology, physical geography, soil science and land use planning.",

Understanding and directing this potential im\u00ad pact is crucial because of the urgent issues that we face concerning sustainable agriculture for a growing world population as well as conservation of the world's rapidly dwindling plant genetic resources. This book is largely devoted to the applications of genetic markers that have been developed by the application of molecular genetics to practical problems. These are known as DNA markers. They have gained a certain notoriety in foren\u00ad sics, but can be used in a variety of practical situations. We are going through a period of accelerated breakthroughs in molecular ge\u00ad netics. Therefore, the authors of each chapter were encouraged to speculate about both current bottlenecks and the future of their subfields of research. We can cer\u00ad tainly apply molecular genetic tools and approaches to help resolve crucial ge\u00ad netic resource problems that face humanity. However, little has been discussed with respect to when or how we should use such tools, nor to who specifically should use them; therefore, social and economic analyses are important in the planning stages of projects that are aimed at practical results.",

          "description": "Due to the rapid increase in readily available computing power, a corre\u00ad sponding increase in the complexity of problems being tackled has occurred in the field of systems as a whole. A plethora of new methods which can be used on the problems has also arisen with a constant desire to deal with more and more difficult applications. Unfortunately by increasing the ac\u00ad curacy in models employed along with the use of appropriate algorithms with related features, the resultant necessary computations can often be of very high dimension. This brings with it a whole new breed of problem which has come to be known as \"The Curse of Dimensionality\" . The expression \"Curse of Dimensionality\" can be in fact traced back to Richard Bellman in the 1960's. However, it is only in the last few years that it has taken on a widespread practical significance although the term di\u00ad mensionality does not have a unique precise meaning and is being used in a slightly different way in the context of algorithmic and stochastic complex\u00ad ity theory or in every day engineering. In principle the dimensionality of a problem depends on three factors: on the engineering system (subject), on the concrete task to be solved and on the available resources. A system is of high dimension if it contains a lot of elements/variables and/or the rela\u00ad tionship/connection between the elements/variables is complicated.",

He grows up learning about current medical practices by watching his father and sister and by listening to the great Professor Turisanus, for whom his father works. Tibaldo is fascinated by medicine and proves himself to be a fast learner, quickly gaining the respect of Professor Turasanus, who becomes a mentor for Tibaldo and sends him to the very best of schools. However, when Tibaldo learns that the Julian calendar is about to be revised, he realizes that he is about to lose his 13th birthday and determines to do something about this.

The collection of papers in this volume cover a diverse array of ecological and evolutionary questions and demonstrates the breadth of coverage molecular tech\u00ad nology has imparted on modern evolutionary biology. There are also a broad range of hierarchical questions approached by the 17 papers in this volume.",

However, if we want to improve the quality of life of the world population with the help of access to information and education, it is necessary that in the next decade an additional five billion people gain access to the Internet. The next five billion Internet users are mainly living in emerging economies. Therefore, the main challenge is to lower the economic barrier using new approaches for infrastructure deployment and service delivery to billions of people. This book reflects the discussions of  the challenges from the Münchner Kreis with representatives from the ICT industry, academia, non-governmental organizations and governmental development organizations, among them many representatives from emerging economies in Africa and Asia. They had highlighted the real demand for ICT, and what impact ICT creates for the wealth and lifestyle of the people.",

What should this concept be taken to mean? \nStarting from the analysis of requirements and principles regulating, generally speaking, the relationships between Member States’ and EU law, this book provides a definition of procedural autonomy able to account for the concept’s inherent limits. \nOut of an analysis of the more relevant EU jurisprudence, the author identifies the rationale underlying the interventions of the ECJ on issues of procedural autonomy and the common logic that emerges from it; and reveals how, in an unchanged context of ‘procedural autonomy’ of the Member States, national procedural law becomes more and more ‘functionalized’ to the requirements of effectiveness of substantive EU law. As such, we should speak of a ‘functionalized procedural competence’ rather than of procedural autonomy. But this is by no means a case of “Paradise Lost.”\nThe book includes a foreword by Prof. Jürgen Schwarze, one of the founding fathers of European Administrative Law.",

This has been discussed in many books and articles on digital preservation, so why is there a need for yet one more? Because, for the most part, those other publications focus on documents, images and webpages – objects that are normally rendered to be simply displayed by software to a human viewer. Yet there are clearly many more types of digital objects that may need to be preserved, such as databases, scientific data and software itself.</p><p>David Giaretta, Director of the Alliance for Permanent Access,  and his contributors explain why the tools and techniques used for preserving rendered objects are inadequate for all these other types of digital objects, and they provide the concepts, techniques and tools that are needed. The book is structured in three parts. The first part is on theory, i.e., the concepts and techniques that are essential for preserving digitally encoded information. The second part then shows practice, i.e., the use and validation of these tools and techniques. Finally, the third part concludes by addressing how to judge whether money is being well spent, in terms of effectiveness and cost sharing.</p><p>Various examples of digital objects from many sources are used to explain the tools and techniques presented. The presentation style mainly aims at practitioners in libraries, archives and industry who are either directly responsible for preservation or who need to prepare for audits of their archives. Researchers in digital preservation and developers of preservation tools and techniques will also find valuable practical information here. Researchers creating digitally encoded information of all kinds will also need to be aware of these topics so that they can help to ensure that their data is usable and can be valued by others now and in the future.</p><p>To further assist the reader, the book is supported by many hours of videos and presentations from the CASPAR project and by a set of open source software.</p>",

Applications of this technology include studies of tissue development and function, investigations of drug response, and tissue repair and replacement. Tissue engineering is rapidly becoming one of the most promising treatment options for patients suffering from tissue failure.\n\nThis abundantly illustrated and clearly structured guide, written by leading experts, is intended to serve as a reference for all clinicians and researchers who deal with tissue engineering issues in their daily practice and for students studying tissue engineering at both the undergraduate and the graduate level. It will also be invaluable for professionals in related research areas, particularly those where cell and tissue culture is a new or emerging tool. The book is divided into three sections that present the latest findings in tissue engineering and their application in clinical practice. The first section discusses the basics and principles of tissue engineering, including scaffolds, cells, and technologies. The second and third sections then address in detail the tissue engineering of specific organs and tissue types. A visual approach is emphasized throughout, with numerous self-explanatory graphics, diagrams, and photos.",

Using various static and oscillating magnetic fields, and tracer materials made from iron oxide nanoparticles, MPI can perform background-free measurements of the particles’ local concentration. The method exploits the nonlinear remagnetization behavior of the particles and has the potential to surpass current methods for the detection of iron oxide in terms of sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution. Starting from an introduction to the technology, the topics addressed include setting up an imaging device, assessment of image quality, development of new MPI tracer materials, and the first preclinical results. This is the first book to be published on magnetic particle imaging, and it will be an invaluable source of information for everyone with an interest in this exciting new modality.</p>",

          "description": "<p>This new edition of Quantitative Sociodynamics presents a general strategy for interdisciplinary model building and its application to a quantitative description of behavioral changes based on social interaction processes. Originally, the crucial methods for the modeling of complex systems (stochastic methods and nonlinear dynamics) were developed in physics and mathematics, but they have very often proven their explanatory power in chemistry, biology, economics and the social sciences as well. Quantitative Sociodynamics provides a unified and comprehensive overview of the different stochastic methods, their interrelations and properties. In addition, it introduces important concepts from nonlinear dynamics (e.g. synergetics, chaos theory). The applicability of these fascinating concepts to social phenomena is carefully discussed. By incorporating decision-theoretical approaches, a fundamental dynamic model is obtained, which opens new perspectives in the social sciences. It includes many established models as special cases, e.g. the logistic equation, the gravity model, some diffusion models, evolutionary game theory and social field theory. Moreover, it implies numerous new results and is relevant for various application areas, such as opinion formation, migration, the self-organization of behavioral conventions, and the behavior of customers and voters. Theoretical results are complemented and illustrated by numerous computer simulations.</p><p>Quantitative Sociodynamics is relevant both for social scientists and natural scientists who are interested in the application of stochastic and synergetics concepts to interdisciplinary topics. </p>",

Yet the effectiveness and quality of these programs vary considerably, sometimes resulting in the reverse of expected outcomes. While local political issues or cultural conflicts may play a part in these situations, an important new book points to a universal factor: the prevailing deficit model of assessing health needs, which puts disadvantaged communities on the defensive while ignoring their potential strengths.\n\nThe asset model proposed in Health Assets in a Global Context offers a necessary complement to the problem-focused framework by assessing multiple levels of health-promoting aspects in populations, and promoting joint solutions between communities and outside agencies. The book provides not only rationales and methodologies (e.g., measuring resilience and similar elusive qualities) but also concrete examples of asset-based initiatives in use across the world on the individual and community levels, including:\n\n•\tStrengthening the assets of disadvantaged women (Germany).\n•\tSustainable community-based development programs (India).\n•\tUsing parental assets to control child malaria (West Africa).\n•\tAsset/evidence-based health promotion in the schools (Romania).\n•\tEvaluating asset-based programs (Latin America).\n•\tUsing social capital to promote health equity (Australia).\n\nHealth Assets in a Global Context offers a new, positive lens for viewing the world’s most resistant public health crises, making it fundamental reading for researchers and graduate students in public health, especially those involved in health promotion, health disparities, social determinants of health, and global health.",

Securing these networks has traditionally been approached by taking a conventional approach involving cryptographic protocols. Such an approach inherently seeks to secure the wireless network at the link layer and above, and consequently fails to leverage the most unique characteristic of wireless communication: its physical layer.</P>\n<P>Securing Wireless Communications at the Physical Layer is a compilation of contributions by experts in wireless communications and security, and presents state-of-the-art results that examine the challenge of introducing security at the physical layer of a wireless system. Throughout this book there is an underlying theme that the rich multipath environment that is typical of wireless scenarios supports the establishment of new security services at the physical layer, including new mechanisms that establish cryptographic keys, that support communication with assured confidentiality, and that can authenticate transmitters in mobile environments. The book takes a holistic approach to covering topics related to physical layer security solutions, with contributions ranging from the theoretical underpinnings behind secure communications to practical systems validations that have been performed on real wireless systems. The book also covers topics related to ensuring that cooperative wireless communications at the physical layer is trustworthy. Additionally, the emerging area of modulation forensics, whereby a device is able to identify the modulation format being employed by other devices is explored.</P>\n<P>Securing Wireless Communications at the Physical Layer will serve as a valuable reference to engineers and researchers in the fields of security and wireless communications.</P>",

          "description": "<P>The crisis of the Santa Barbara offshore oil spill in 1969 led to the passage of radically new environmental laws that made the United States an international leader in environmental protection at the time. Since then, environmental regulation has proved detrimental to both industrial and environmental performance. It contributed to a deepening confrontation between environmental and industrial groups, a rift which spread to other areas of politics and society. This book traces the origin of the current conflict and carefully analyzes current environmental and resource policy. Other advanced nations, especially in the EU, evolved more sophisticated and cooperative policies. These have led to high environmental quality and have permitted the EU to lead in global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the environmental regulatory policies have fostered robust industrial and fiscal performance. Americans know something has gone wrong in the U.S. The book's candid comparison of U.S. and EU policies yields fresh perspectives on sources of U.S. dilemmas in energy policy, Congressional lawmaking, and other areas of concern.</P>\n<P>\"Managing the environment has become an issue of such bitter partisanship in the U.S. that the prospects for further progress may seem bleak. Frank Manheim's detailed, even-handed, and historically grounded analysis offers a generous counterpoint to today's rancorous environmental politics. His book challenges Americans to look beyond domestic gridlock, and regain perspective by taking advantage of EU experience and building a sense of mission around the interlocking goals of climate stabilization, energy independence, and economic vitality.\"</P>\n<P>-Daniel Sarewitz, Director of the Consortium for Science, Policy, and Outcomes, Arizona State University</P>\n<P>&nbsp;Frank T.

This decidedly immodest assessment is widely viewed amongst the group as being manifestly true, and that perception is clearly reflected in a marvelous esprit de corp. Such an unequivocally positive attitude is solidly based on the judgment that the best possible care is provided to each MGH patient, i.e. the patient is, in fact, Number One. There is a deep sense of pride in the contributions made by this department to the scientific advancement of oncology, with an objective to continue progressively and substantially increasing the proportion of patients who are free of tumor and of treatment related morbidity.  \n\nEvolution of Radiation of Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital is the work of the former Chair of the Department, Herman D. Suit, with his successor, Jay S. Loeffler.  From 1970 – 2000, Dr. Suit’s guidance and management of this Department brought it to recognition as a world class center.  Dr. Suit was key in developing and building the Department that now includes The Northeast Proton Therapy Center at the MGH.  His passion for the science of radiation therapy and its evolution through the years is evident in this book.   Dr. Loeffler is a pioneer in the development and application of novel radiation delivery technologies and the use of biologics to enhance radiation effect for patients with brain tumors.  Dr. Suit and Dr. Loeffler continue their close collaboration at MGH.  This fascinating chronicle begins with the creation of MGH in 1811, followed by personal experiences of the Radiation Oncology Department.",

          "description": "<P>Linear programming attracted the interest of mathematicians during and after World War II when the first computers were constructed and methods for solving large linear programming problems were sought in connection with specific practical problems—for example, providing logistical support for the U.S. Armed Forces or modeling national economies. Early attempts to apply linear programming methods to solve practical problems failed to satisfy expectations. There were various reasons for the failure. One of them, which is the central topic of this book, was the inexactness of the data used to create the models. This phenomenon, inherent in most pratical problems, has been dealt with in several ways. At first, linear programming models used \"average” values of inherently vague coefficients, but the optimal solutions of these models&nbsp;were not always optimal for the original problem itself. Later researchers developed the stochastic linear programming approach, but this too has its limitations. Recently, interest has been given to linear programming problems with data given as intervals, convex sets and/or fuzzy sets. The individual results of these studies have been promising, but the literature has not presented a unified theory.&nbsp;<STRONG>Linear Optimization Problems with Inexact Data</STRONG>&nbsp;attempts to present a comprehensive treatment of linear optimization with inexact data, summarizing existing results and presenting new ones within a unifying framework.</P>\n<P><EM>Audience</EM></P>\n<P>This book is intended for postgraduate or graduate students in the areas of operations research, optimization theory, linear algebra, interval analysis, reliable computing, and fuzzy sets.

The idea for this textbook was born out of a need for a teaching resource that merges medical ethics theory with the practical needs of modern clinical medicine. In <EM>Evidence-Based Medical Ethics: Cases for Practice-Based Learning</EM>, the authors address what has been missing in existing text books and ethics courses to date – clear-cut ethical and legal guidelines that provide a method for the reader to learn how to systematically manage dilemmas seen in the everyday practice of medicine. The reader is guided through several \"typical\" patient scenarios and prompted by various questions that should be entertained by the treating health care provider. Then, relevant evidence-based medicine, legal precedent, and the ethical theory that applies to the situation are revealed. Often, finding the \"best\" ethical solution for each problem is automatic, as the solution often becomes self-evident during information-gathering. This general method is reinforced throughout the text with multiple different cases, using a practice-based approach by building on the reader’s developing skills. Additionally, we have sought to emphasize a culturally competent manner in resolving these dilemmas, respectfully addressing issues of age, gender, and culture whenever possible. The main goal of <EM>Evidence-Based Medical Ethics: Cases for Practice-Bases Learning</EM> is to assist the reader in adapting a patient-centered and evidence-based approach to dilemmas faced in their future practice of medicine.</P>",

          "description": "In the 8 years since the publication of the first edition of Essentials of Anatomic Pathology, great strides have been made in our understanding of diseases and neoplastic processes. Many clinically important new histopathologic entities have been described or more fully defined in virtually every organ. Numerous clinically important diagnostic and prognostic markers have entered routine practice. Genetic testing for the early detection of cancers and the molecular classification of diseases has become increasingly important. This is an age of enlightenment in surgical pathology, and the authors of this new volume have captured this sense of excitement herein.\n\nThis much praised and widely used reference manual&nbsp;has been extensively revised and expanded to cover the entire field of anatomic pathology. The Third Edition features the incorporation of full-color images in the text with updates of new diagnostic and prognostic information. New classifications and numerous new entities and histologic variants are fully explored. Useful immunostaining biomarkers and emerging molecular targets and relevant molecular findings that have emerged from recent genomic studies are incorporated in each chapter.\n\nWritten by internationally recognized authorities, the comprehensive, evidence-based practice information is presented in an outline format that is clear and easy to follow. Up-to-date and richly detailed, Essentials of Anatomic Pathology, Third Edition offers both the pathologist-in-training and the practicing pathologist a concise summary of all the critical information needed to recognize, understand and interpret anatomic pathology.",

This assumption stems from the idea that the brain consists entirely of material particles and fields, and that all causal mechanisms relevant to neuroscience can be formulated solely in terms of properties of these elements. Contemporary basic physical theory differs from classic physics on the important matter of how consciousness of human agents enters into the structure of empirical phenomena. The new principles contradict the older idea that local mechanical processes alone account for the structure of all empirical data. Contemporary physical theory brings directly into the overall causal structure certain psychologically described choices made by human agents about how they will act. This key development in basic physical theory is applicable to neuroscience. <i>Brain, Mind and Consciousness: Advances in Neuroscience Research</i> explores this new framework.",

          "description": "In this book, we have attempted to produce a reference on high resolution focused ion beams (FIBs) that will be useful for both the user and the designer of FIB instrumentation. We have included a mix of theory and applications that seemed most useful to us. <BR>The field of FIBs has advanced rapidly since the application of the first field emission ion sources in the early 1970s. The development of the liquid metal ion source (LMIS) in the late 1960s and early 1970s and its application for FIBs in the late 1970s have resulted in a powerful tool for research and for industry. There have been hundreds of papers written on many aspects of LMIS and FIBs, and a useful and informative book on these subjects was published in 1991 by Phil Prewett and Grame Mair. Because there have been so many new applications and uses found for FIBs in the last ten years we felt that it was time for another book on the subject. <BR>",
